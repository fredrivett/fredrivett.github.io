<strong>Terms &amp; Conditions</strong>
<p>
  By downloading or using the app, these terms will
  automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
  that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not
  allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or
  our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
  extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try
  to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative
  versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright,
  database rights and other intellectual property rights related
  to it, still belong to Fernoon Limited.
</p>
<p>
  Fernoon Limited is committed to ensuring that the app is
  as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
  reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for
  its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never
  charge you for the app or its services without making it very
  clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
</p>
<p>
  The HeyFrank app stores and processes personal data that
  you have provided to us, in order to provide our
  Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and
  access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
  not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
  removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
  official operating system of your device. It could make your
  phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
  compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean
  that the HeyFrank app won’t work properly or at all.
</p>

  <p>
    The app does use third party services that declare their own
    Terms and Conditions.

<p>
  You should be aware that there are certain things that
  Fernoon Limited will not take responsibility for. Certain
  functions of the app will require the app to have an active
  internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided
  by your mobile network provider, but Fernoon Limited
  cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
  functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
  have any of your data allowance left.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
  should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
  mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
  be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
  the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
  other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
  responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
  charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
  (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
  you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
  using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
  received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
</p>
<p>
  Along the same lines, Fernoon Limited cannot always take
  responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
  make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
  battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,
  Fernoon Limited cannot accept responsibility.
</p>
<p>
  With respect to Fernoon Limited’s responsibility for your
  use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to
  bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is
  updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
  to provide information to us so that we can make it available
  to you. Fernoon Limited accepts no liability for any
  loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
  relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
</p>
<p>
  At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
  currently available on iOS – the requirements for
  system(and for any additional systems we
  decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
  and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
  using the app. Fernoon Limited does not promise that it
  will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
  and/or works with the iOS version that you have
  installed on your device. However, you promise to always
  accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
  also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
  it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
  Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
  rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
  (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it
  from your device.
