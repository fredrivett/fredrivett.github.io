Super Powerful

### How we sucked at launching anything ever

Just over 2 years ago, it happened again. After months of work, we’d thrown the towel in on another project.

It had happened again. We had failed, again. Almost two years ago, we had tried to create a website builder specifically aimed at plumbers. But after working on it for over three months, we threw the towel in. Yet again we'd failed to launch anything at all.

Why were we so hopeless at launching anything?

### Regular goals are powerful

Since the turn of the year [Mike](https://twitter.com/mikeaag) and I have been listening to a lot of audio books. Audio books are perfect for the commute and as I commute for roughly 3 hours every day, I've listened to quite a lot.

The other week I was on the lookout for a new book to listen to. I did a quick search, and found that [Ryan Hoover](https://twitter.com/rrhoover) had recommended [The Power of Habit](http://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Health-Personal-Development/The-Power-of-Habit-Audiobook/B007AK4V62). That sounded interesting, so I went ahead and downloaded it for my commute home.

Habits are powerful. Since the turn of the year I've been Intermittently Fasting, where I don't eat for 24 hours twice a week. Having done this for so long now it honestly feels _easier_ to continue fasting two days a week than to go back to my old ways of eating 3 meals each and every day. The habit has become a pattern that is now second nature to me. It now costs me more mental energy to _not_ fast than it does to fast. The habit has stuck, and I'm much healthier as a result.

All this goes to show how we are creatures of habit. Our brains would never be able to cope if it didn't account for regular patterns and deal with those on auto pilot.

### Public goals are powerful

Setting goals can be powerful. You set your mind on getting into shape each new year, and for the first few weeks you do quite well.

But then, your progress falls away, the habit doesn't stick and you go back to your old ways. Until next year.

How can we increase our chances of following through on our goals? Thankfully there's one relatively simple step you can take that's proven to significantly increase your chances of following through.

_Tell someone._

Sharing your goal with others is powerful. As soon as you tell someone you're going to do something, your inner desire to be true to your word kicks in. This inner drive then competes with your procrastinating, lazy, Homer Simpson drive, and oftentimes wins, leading you to overcome your impotent habits and achieve your goals.

The science backs this. Sharing your goals publicly significantly increases the likelihood of you achieving them:

> "Prompting people to monitor their progress can help them to achieve their goals, but some methods of monitoring are better than others. Specifically, we would recommend that people be encouraged to record, report or make public what they find out as they assess their progress."

### Public regular goals are super powerful

Earlier this week [Nathan Bashaw](https://twitter.com/nbashaw) shared a video talking about [the power of regular, public goals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS6-B_eFF-Q) and it really resonated with me. It resonated because I'd seen that power at work before.

In video he shares how XX YY ZZ.

What Nathan shared here is key. Public goals are powerful, regular goals are powerful, and public, regular goals are *super powerful*.

### We went from never launching to launching six projects in eight months due to public regular goals.

One of the key changes we made after the latest failure two years back was to get serious with deadlines. To stop messing around working on projects with no real end in sight, but instead to set short-term, regular, attainable deadlines for shipping.

We'd grown so tired of continually failing to launch that we were desperate. We knew this was a lesson that we had to ingrain into the core of how we worked, so rather than aim to launch one project in one month, we set ourselves the goal of launching [six projects in six months](https://blog.wearecontrast.com/introducing-sixbysix-217d608362#.jeqjudq9a).

On top of setting this goal we decided to share our progress, blogging regularly about how we were getting on.

This may look like a stroke of genius on our part. That we knew how powerful public, regular goals were and so set off on that path knowing we'd succeed.

Not quite. We just went with our hunch. Setting multiple regular goals seemed to make sense to help rewire our previous behaviour, and sharing those with others, well, what's to be lost?

As it turns out, these two ingredients, setting regular goals and sharing them, were the single biggest changes we made, and have had a huge impact on our productivity since.

Since setting that goal we've launched [9 new projects](https://wearecontrast.com/), including [a book sharing what we learnt from the whole process](https://learningtolaunch.co/), nearly all of that whilst working full-time jobs.

We're now able to launch [new side projects from scratch over a weekend](https://blog.wearecontrast.com/make-stuff-ff82f78cf5a9#.i7ilu5kan) when previously we'd spend months and still not ship anything.

This isn't anything to say we're special. Not at all. Other have done this with far greater success than us. Just look at [Pieter Levels](https://twitter.com/levelsio).

Levels set himself a goal to launch 12 startups in 12 months a few months before we set out on our goal. How'd he do? He's now on $30k MRR from these projects. Not bad if you ask me.

I can't speak for Levels, but I know for us, the combination of regular goals and sharing them publicly totally changed our output.

Public regular goals have been super powerful.

### It’s time to up my game

Fast forward a few months and here I am, ready to take the next step. To step out with my latest, public, regular goal.

The goal this time? Writing. I want to write more. As well as this, Mike and I are also starting a new podcast in the next few weeks.

It's no good saying we'll podcast when we want, we have to set ourselves regular goals. The same goes with my writing.

That's why, for both these goals, we're committing to shipping weekly. Every week we'll ship a podcast episode. Every week, I'll ship a new blog post. Every week, we'll have people waiting to receive our weekly email in their inbox.

And here I am, telling you. Telling you we're about to do something we've never done before, and do it regularly. Pretty intimidated by that fact, as I write this on my train home from my day job. Scared we'll flop publicly and make a fool of ourselves.

But I know the power of public regular goals, so I'll harness it for all its worth. It's time to step out again.

#### Where do you want to be?

Where do you want to be in six months time? What do you need to change in order to get there?

It's time to get serious. I challenge you, set at least one regular, attainable goal this week.

Write a blog post _and share it_. Or if that's too much, hit reply to this post and let _me_ know, I'd love to hear it.
