            <p>A week ago <a href="https://twitter.com/marckohlbrugge">Marc K√∂hlbrugge</a> released a neat little side project. The premise was simple, pay to get featured on the site. We‚Äôve seen this before, right?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/">The million dollar homepage</a>.</p>

<p>The twist here? The more you pay, the higher you‚Äôll be featured on the leaderboard. This gamified the system, with individuals and companies paying more and more for the highest position. Marc managed to use his existing networks to bring the initial burst of traffic through, and pretty soon the ball was well and truly rolling.</p>

<p>If you want some traffic to your site now would be a good time to participate: <a href="https://highscore.money/">http://highscore.money</a>.</p>

<cite><a href="https://twitter.com/marckohlbrugge?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@marckohlbrugge on twitter</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And by the end of the day Marc had done <a href="https://medium.com/@marckohlbrugge/how-i-made-2-251-in-1-day-with-highscore-money-dd56b35b2681#.i58k99t77">pretty well</a>:</p>

<p>This sort of project clearly comes under the silly little side projects umbrella. It was an opportunistic attempt to make a quick buck, whilst providing value to those who paid for a slot and having fun along the way.</p>

<p>As makers, quick side projects like this help flex our creative muscles. I don‚Äôt think Marc intended this to be a fully fledged business, he‚Äôs already focussed in on his main gig, BetaList, but that didn‚Äôt stop him spending a few days creating this.</p>

<p>Whilst following Marc‚Äôs launch day progress, one tweet from Marc struck me, and got me thinking.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What's a good, privacy-friendly real-time website counter?

</blockquote>

<p>This was the second time I‚Äôd seen a request for some form of user facing site stats. A few weeks before, <a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin">Justin Jackson</a> had written <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/webmaster/">I‚Äôm a fucking webmaster</a>, and wrote <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11685868">this comment on his Hacker News post</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>BTW: does anyone know of a lightweight, retro ‚Äúhit counter‚Äù that can grab my GA stats and display them at the bottom?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A pattern was forming here, enough for me to mention to <a href="https://twitter.com/mikeaag">Mike</a> that this might be something for us to explore.</p>

<p>Mike and I have been working on side projects for years, but only recently have we got into the habit of actually launching them. Having set ourselves the challenge to launch <a href="https://blog.wearecontrast.com/introducing-sixbysix-217d608362#.gpqkok2i1">six projects in six months</a> at the end of 2014, we‚Äôve launched <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/@mikeaag/collections/i-made-that">8 side projects since</a>, including writing our first book about the whole process, <a href="https://learningtolaunch.co/">Learning to Launch</a>.</p>

<p>More recently though, we‚Äôve been focussing on thinking through problems we want to solve, areas of tech we‚Äôre interested in, potential markets we‚Äôd enjoy helping. We‚Äôve been thinking a lot about the startup we want to build.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs easy to get stuck in analysis paralysis. It‚Äôs important that we keep moving forwards. That‚Äôs why, this past weekend, we spent most of it hacking together a small side project, inspired by Marc‚Äôs tweet.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-real-time-users">Introducing Real Time Users</h2>

<p>Sometimes you‚Äôve gotta have some fun and build stuff. That‚Äôs what Marc did, and that‚Äôs what we decided to do, too. Real Time Users is a little side project that makes us smile.</p>

<p>Real Time Users is vulnerable, it exposes the truth of how popular your site is. Go to it anytime, and you‚Äôll likely be greeted by the fact you‚Äôre the only person on the internet there. That‚Äôs both beautiful to know, that you are alone on this piece of internet real estate, and, as a creator, leaves me feeling slightly exposed. You know how popular my site is. For us at least, that‚Äôs a new level of transparency.</p>

<p>Partially inspired by Marc‚Äôs leaderboard, we‚Äôve included <a href="https://realtimeusers.bycontrast.co/leaderboard">one of our own</a>. If you take the 60 seconds and add Real Time Users to your site, you‚Äôll likely take up one of the top 10 slots, until at least 8 others add it to their sites too. You‚Äôll be able to see whether anyone ever adds this to their site, simply by tracking whether those top 10 slots ever fill up.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm proud of it, proud because, having discussed it a few times during the week, we only really got to work on it this past weekend, and by Sunday evening we were pretty much ready to go.</p>

<p>On a walk with Mike the other night I asked him, how long would it have taken us to launch Real Time Users pre-SixBySix? His answer: <em>we‚Äôd have never shipped it.</em></p>

<p>He‚Äôs right <em>(don‚Äôt tell him that)</em>. We wouldn‚Äôt have. We would have added feature after feature, built with needless shiny technology, and delayed launching month by month as we strived to build the next Google Analytics.</p>

<p>Since SixBySix, we‚Äôre much quicker to launch, and the quality has improved too. Our first project, <a href="http://howsitgo.in/">HowsItGoin</a> took 250 hours to ship. Real Time Users took under 15.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs what we‚Äôve learnt, these past eighteen months. Ship stuff. Keep moving forwards. Learn as you go.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Building and launching stuff is a skill, a habit, a muscle. The more you do it, the better you get.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Spending the past month or so thinking through what we want to be focussing on, the business we want to build, has been an essential step. But sometimes we need to <a href="https://twitter.com/FredRivett/status/737384708024238084">step away from the magic whiteboards</a> and get back to making stuff.</p>

<p>Who knows what‚Äôll come of it.</p>
