<p><em>[You can also find this blog post <a href="https://blog.wearecontrast.com/launch-c3968191a5b7">on Medium</a>]</em></p>

<p>In this weekâ€™s blog post I attempt to answer the questions: <em>What does it look like to launch from the inside?</em> And <em>How on earth did we get to second on the Hacker News homepage?</em></p>

<p>If you like the sound of that, <a href="https://hitreply.co/1">this weeks episode of our new podcast, Hit Reply, is all about launching</a> (sound of that, get it, get it?)</p>

<p>Without further ado:</p>

<hr />

<p>Last week we launched a new project that weâ€™ve been discussing for a couple months, our first ever podcast, <a href="http://hitreply.co/">Hit Reply</a>.</p>

<p>Hit Reply is a podcast that gives you an inside view on what itâ€™s like to start a startup.</p>

<p>For the past two years, weâ€™ve spent our evenings, weekends and holidays building and launching stuff. Before that, we werenâ€™t very good at launching. In fact, we were awful.</p>

<p>Since doubling down on shipping side projects, <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/@fredrivett/collections/things-i-ve-made">weâ€™ve launched 9 in the last 2 years</a>. Hit Reply, is our 10th.</p>

<p>Hit Reply is a bit different to the rest. Most projects have one main "weâ€™re here!" launch, when the curtain comes down and the masses (hopefully) swell in.</p>

<p>Hit Reply though, is a podcast. Weâ€™ll be releasing a new episode <em>every week</em>. Every Tuesday, we get another shot at another little release.</p>

<p>Podcasts have been growing in popularity. New podcast episodes can now vie for a place on <a href="http://www.producthunt.com/">Product Huntâ€™s homepage</a>. As well as that, lots of the tech folks over at <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> listen to podcasts. A fact that we hadnâ€™t quite fully realised.</p>

<p>On Tuesday the countdown to our first episode had just ticked over to <em>0 days, 0 hours, 0 minutes</em>. It wasnâ€™t live yet.</p>

<p>I had the week off work, and Iâ€™d had quite a relaxed morning, going through my new morning routine. 10 minutes meditation. 5 minutes free flow writing. 10 ideas. Exercise.</p>

<p>Iâ€™d underestimated how long it would take to make the final edits to our first episode, and the tweaks that weâ€™d need to make to the website.</p>

<p>About two and a half hours after our scheduled launch time, we were ready. <a href="http://hitreply.co/">Episode 0: Yet Another Startup Podcast?</a> was live.</p>

<p>We sent out our email to our weekly list, and that was that.</p>

<p>The next day, a little later than planned, we submitted our first little episode to Product Hunt. We were keen to see how much traffic Product Hunt sent to podcast episodes.</p>

<p>Within half an hour or so, it was doing relatively well, even competing with YCombinatorâ€™s interview with Jessica Livingston (spoiler: they won).</p>

<p>As a sort of side note, we submitted the episode to Hacker News. For us, Hacker News is much more of a mystery. Due to the free-for-all nature and size of the system, weâ€™re never quite sure what will happen when we submit something to Hacker News. You can easily get lost in the masses.</p>

<p>We submitted it, and left it at that. A few minutes later we started to see some upvotes trickle in. Who was that? People were upvoting <em>our podcast?</em></p>

<p>About fifteen minutes in, I stumbled onto the homepage by accident. Wait, whatâ€™s going on? Weâ€™re #4 on the homepage? This canâ€™t be right!?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Erm erm erm erm erm erm erm
Weâ€™re 4th on HN homepage? Am i reading this wrong?
<cite><a href="https://twitter.com/FredRivett/status/770987008793702400">Tweet on the Twitters</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>It was right.</em> We were 4th on the Hacker News homepage.</p>

<p>Then 3rd ðŸ˜¦</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Weâ€™re now 3rd. THIRD. ON THE HACKERNEWS HOMEPAGE.
I donâ€™t know whats happening anymore.
<cite><a href="https://twitter.com/FredRivett/status/770987971772375040">Another tweet hits the twitters</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then 2nd ðŸ˜±</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How is this getting evening happening
<cite><a href="https://twitter.com/FredRivett/status/770988331584851968">Tweets keep rollin'</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our little podcast was second on Hacker News.</p>

<p>After a few minutes, it began to slide back down a few slots, and sat most of the day between 5th and 7th. A pretty handy place to be.</p>

<p>So what did we learn from this?</p>

<h3 id="launch-early">Launch early</h3>

<p>The 80/20 rule states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.</p>

<p>This rule applies to launching too. We can all get to a point where we have a website with our first episode recorded. <strong>Itâ€™s often the feeling that you need to have all your ducks in a row that leads you to delay launching, oftentimes, forever.</strong></p>

<p>The reason? <em>Youâ€™ll never have all your ducks in a row.</em> There will always be things that could be done better. Never has there been a to-do list thatâ€™s actually empty.</p>

<p>The key to launching is to tick off the big wins. Get a website up. Record an episode with whatever equipment you have. Then share it.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s really that simple.</p>

<p>We specifically took shortcuts to get Hit Reply to launch now. Our website is a bunch of simple PHP files that I knocked together. Itâ€™s a systemised mess. Over the long term it will slow us down a little, but we can tweak on the journey.</p>

<p>The CSS is just CSS, not Sass, which Iâ€™d normally use. This was due to a roadblock that weâ€™d hit in a previous project, that took a while to get around. Doing it this way wasnâ€™t as nice or as fast to develop, but got the job done so we could move on.</p>

<p>We launched without being on iTunes. We werenâ€™t even in apps like <a href="http://www.shiftyjelly.com/pocketcasts/">Pocket Casts</a>. People were wanting to subscribe on their favourite podcast app, and we werenâ€™t there.</p>

<p><em>Did we launch too early?</em></p>

<p>No. I donâ€™t think so. We had to get the ball rolling with the podcast, we knew it was time to launch. We planned to submit our podcast to iTunes after a few episodes, and honestly hadnâ€™t heard of Pocket Casts.</p>

<p>We forgot to add an RSS feed for people to use to subscribe on their platforms, but soon corrected this with some quick changes on launch day.</p>

<p>Equally, with the unexpected masses flooding in, we added a quick <a href="https://realtimeusers.bycontrast.co/">real time user counter</a>, a project weâ€™d worked on a couple months before, to the site.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/FredRivett/status/770991865135005697">https://twitter.com/FredRivett/status/770991865135005697</a></p>

<h3 id="where-are-we-at-now">Where are we at now?</h3>

<p>Now, in the aftermath of the launch, what was the result?</p>

<p>The podcast episode has had over <a href="http://hitreply.co/ep/0/yet-another-startup-podcast/">950 plays</a>, far more than we could have hoped for our initial launch.</p>

<p>Our <a href="http://twitter.com/hitreplypod">twitter account</a> has its first 21 followers (thanks). A small start, but nice nonetheless.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ve had some great feedback and we now know that some people are interested in listening. This is a big plus and one of the key questions to ask yourself when you launch, does anyone care?</p>

<p>But one of the biggest gains, <a href="http://hitreply.co/">our email list</a> has had 57 new sign ups, boosting it up from 202 subscribers to 259. Thatâ€™s a nice healthy jump.</p>

<h3 id="where-do-we-go-from-here">Where do we go from here?</h3>

<p>Nowâ€™s where the real challenge kicks in. Shipping something is a milestone, an achievement of sorts. Our previous projects were the result of a challenge we set ourselves to get better at shipping stuff, but this is an ongoing project. Each week, a new episode. Consistency here is key.</p>

<p>Weâ€™re excited to see how this grows. Our first â€˜properâ€™ episode, <a href="https://hitreply.co/1">Episode 1, is all about launching</a>. Give it a listen if youâ€™ve got a mo, and if you do, please <strong>Hit Reply</strong> and let us know what you think.</p>
