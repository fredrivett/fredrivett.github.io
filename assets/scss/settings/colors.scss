/**
 * my-colors map
 *
 * This map allows us to neatly organise all our colours. We can then access
 *  them using the `my-color` function in tools/_functions.scss. The real
 *  benefit, however, is for use with our buttons (components/_buttons.scss)
 *  which use our function with a @mixin bg-color to set background colours
 *  in one fell swoop.
 *
 * Our default style for normal colours is like so:
 *  color: ( standard: the-normal-hex, dark: dark-hex )
 *  and for our greyscale colours, we've put these in their own map (they're
 *  not really colours after all). To add a new greyscale colour, just uncomment
 *  the closest hex value and use (via my-color function in _functions.scss).
 *  If you do need a new greyscale colour feel free to change the hex value
 *  when uncommenting, but once in use be very careful about changing values
 *  as this will obviously change the colours in some areas of the site.
 *
 * NOTE: If no 'dark' or 'darker' value is supplied here, we can still use it
 *  as our my-color() function will generate it for us. Settings on how much
 *  'dark' or 'darker' these are is in the my-color() function.
