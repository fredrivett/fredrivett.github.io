    <content type="html">&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this week’s blog post I attempt to answer the questions: &lt;em&gt;What does it look like to launch from the inside?&lt;/em&gt; And &lt;em&gt;How on earth did we get to second on the Hacker News homepage?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like the sound of that, &lt;a href="https://hitreply.co/1"&gt;this weeks episode of our new podcast, Hit Reply, is all about launching&lt;/a&gt; (sound of that, get it, get it?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week we launched a new project that we’ve been discussing for a couple months, our first ever podcast, &lt;a href="http://hitreply.co/"&gt;Hit Reply&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hit Reply is a podcast that gives you an inside view on what it’s like to start a startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past two years, we’ve spent our evenings, weekends and holidays building and launching stuff. Before that, we weren’t very good at launching. In fact, we were awful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since doubling down on shipping side projects, &lt;a href="https://www.producthunt.com/@fredrivett/collections/things-i-ve-made"&gt;we’ve launched 9 in the last 2 years&lt;/a&gt;. Hit Reply, is our 10th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hit Reply is a bit different to the rest. Most projects have one main "we’re here!" launch, when the curtain comes down and the masses (hopefully) swell in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hit Reply though, is a podcast. We’ll be releasing a new episode &lt;em&gt;every week&lt;/em&gt;. Every Tuesday, we get another shot at another little release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Podcasts have been growing in popularity. New podcast episodes can now vie for a place on &lt;a href="http://www.producthunt.com/"&gt;Product Hunt’s homepage&lt;/a&gt;. As well as that, lots of the tech folks over at &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/"&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; listen to podcasts. A fact that we hadn’t quite fully realised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday the countdown to our first episode had just ticked over to &lt;em&gt;0 days, 0 hours, 0 minutes&lt;/em&gt;. It wasn’t live yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the week off work, and I’d had quite a relaxed morning, going through my new morning routine. 10 minutes meditation. 5 minutes free flow writing. 10 ideas. Exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d underestimated how long it would take to make the final edits to our first episode, and the tweaks that we’d need to make to the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About two and a half hours after our scheduled launch time, we were ready. &lt;a href="http://hitreply.co/"&gt;Episode 0: Yet Another Startup Podcast?&lt;/a&gt; was live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sent out our email to our weekly list, and that was that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, a little later than planned, we submitted our first little episode to Product Hunt. We were keen to see how much traffic Product Hunt sent to podcast episodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within half an hour or so, it was doing relatively well, even competing with YCombinator’s interview with Jessica Livingston (spoiler: they won).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a sort of side note, we submitted the episode to Hacker News. For us, Hacker News is much more of a mystery. Due to the free-for-all nature and size of the system, we’re never quite sure what will happen when we submit something to Hacker News. You can easily get lost in the masses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We submitted it, and left it at that. A few minutes later we started to see some upvotes trickle in. Who was that? People were upvoting &lt;em&gt;our podcast?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About fifteen minutes in, I stumbled onto the homepage by accident. Wait, what’s going on? We’re #4 on the homepage? This can’t be right!?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Erm erm erm erm erm erm erm
We’re 4th on HN homepage? Am i reading this wrong?
&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FredRivett/status/770987008793702400"&gt;Tweet on the Twitters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It was right.&lt;/em&gt; We were 4th on the Hacker News homepage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then 3rd 😦&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We’re now 3rd. THIRD. ON THE HACKERNEWS HOMEPAGE.
I don’t know whats happening anymore.
&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FredRivett/status/770987971772375040"&gt;Another tweet hits the twitters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then 2nd 😱&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;How is this getting evening happening
&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FredRivett/status/770988331584851968"&gt;Tweets keep rollin'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our little podcast was second on Hacker News.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few minutes, it began to slide back down a few slots, and sat most of the day between 5th and 7th. A pretty handy place to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what did we learn from this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="launch-early"&gt;Launch early&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 80/20 rule states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rule applies to launching too. We can all get to a point where we have a website with our first episode recorded. &lt;strong&gt;It’s often the feeling that you need to have all your ducks in a row that leads you to delay launching, oftentimes, forever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason? &lt;em&gt;You’ll never have all your ducks in a row.&lt;/em&gt; There will always be things that could be done better. Never has there been a to-do list that’s actually empty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key to launching is to tick off the big wins. Get a website up. Record an episode with whatever equipment you have. Then share it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really that simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We specifically took shortcuts to get Hit Reply to launch now. Our website is a bunch of simple PHP files that I knocked together. It’s a systemised mess. Over the long term it will slow us down a little, but we can tweak on the journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSS is just CSS, not Sass, which I’d normally use. This was due to a roadblock that we’d hit in a previous project, that took a while to get around. Doing it this way wasn’t as nice or as fast to develop, but got the job done so we could move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We launched without being on iTunes. We weren’t even in apps like &lt;a href="http://www.shiftyjelly.com/pocketcasts/"&gt;Pocket Casts&lt;/a&gt;. People were wanting to subscribe on their favourite podcast app, and we weren’t there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Did we launch too early?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. I don’t think so. We had to get the ball rolling with the podcast, we knew it was time to launch. We planned to submit our podcast to iTunes after a few episodes, and honestly hadn’t heard of Pocket Casts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We forgot to add an RSS feed for people to use to subscribe on their platforms, but soon corrected this with some quick changes on launch day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally, with the unexpected masses flooding in, we added a quick &lt;a href="https://realtimeusers.bycontrast.co/"&gt;real time user counter&lt;/a&gt;, a project we’d worked on a couple months before, to the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FredRivett/status/770991865135005697"&gt;https://twitter.com/FredRivett/status/770991865135005697&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="where-are-we-at-now"&gt;Where are we at now?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, in the aftermath of the launch, what was the result?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The podcast episode has had over &lt;a href="http://hitreply.co/ep/0/yet-another-startup-podcast/"&gt;950 plays&lt;/a&gt;, far more than we could have hoped for our initial launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/hitreplypod"&gt;twitter account&lt;/a&gt; has its first 21 followers (thanks). A small start, but nice nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve had some great feedback and we now know that some people are interested in listening. This is a big plus and one of the key questions to ask yourself when you launch, does anyone care?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one of the biggest gains, &lt;a href="http://hitreply.co/"&gt;our email list&lt;/a&gt; has had 57 new sign ups, boosting it up from 202 subscribers to 259. That’s a nice healthy jump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="where-do-we-go-from-here"&gt;Where do we go from here?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now’s where the real challenge kicks in. Shipping something is a milestone, an achievement of sorts. Our previous projects were the result of a challenge we set ourselves to get better at shipping stuff, but this is an ongoing project. Each week, a new episode. Consistency here is key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to see how this grows. Our first ‘proper’ episode, &lt;a href="https://hitreply.co/1"&gt;Episode 1, is all about launching&lt;/a&gt;. Give it a listen if you’ve got a mo, and if you do, please &lt;strong&gt;Hit Reply&lt;/strong&gt; and let us know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to keep up to date with the podcast? Get a &lt;a href="http://hitreply.co/"&gt;small, simple email every Tuesday announcing the new episode&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://feeds.soundcloud.com/users/soundcloud:users:245437295/sounds.rss"&gt;subscribe to our RSS&lt;/a&gt; in your favourite podcast player.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Pressure is healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Healthy pressure is, at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without pressure we wouldn’t have diamonds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pressure can keep us on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can push us to go further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/a-breakthrough-is-nothing-without-the-followthrough-87021be7f9b5#.xb7cplqvi"&gt;To follow through&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a part of a mastermind, and every week there’s a pressure to answer the question, "what did you do last week". That pressure is healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have internal pressure. "You talk about startups a lot, you better back up that chat with some action". This pressure is healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every day I get home from my day job late at night and feel tired, with a long to-do list ahead of me. I remember what I’m trying to do and what my future looks like. This pressure is healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I share my goals in public. This pressure is healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all pressure is healthy. Sometimes it can weigh us down rather than spur us on. In those cases, you’ve gotta throw that pressure off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What pressure are you under right now? Is it weighing you down, or pushing you on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throw off the heavy weights, but use some of that healthy pressure to push you forwards. Your future will be better as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Is Overrated</title>

    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We'll always remember our first real lightbulb idea. For me it was late 2009, I was sitting at my desk, on a course that I soon realised wasn't really going to teach me anything that useful. Not that I knew everything – not at all – but the culture there wasn't exactly one of pushing you to be your best, they were just happy that we turned up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This day was different though. As I sat there, daydreaming (as I often do), I realised something – I love reading. I really wanted a place to keep tabs on what I'd read, and maybe add a quick review on what I thought. I'd also quite like a way of finding out what my friends were reading and what they recommend reading next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"Oh! What if there was a Facebook for book readers! That'd be awesome!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-master-plan"&gt;The Master Plan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That evening on the train home I rang &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mikeaag"&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt; to chat about the idea. We were both really excited about what it could be. We even came up with a super awesome codename (#blackhawk) so that no eavesdroppers would pick up on our idea and run off into the distance with our millions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then spent the next week writing up exactly what the site would do, what each page's purpose was and sketched out roughly how it would look. I had 6 or 7 pages of pure gold, or at least that's what I thought at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With my plan in hand we agreed to meet up at a nearby pub. We sat in the garden next to a quiet stream with a good beer and talked it through. We spent a good couple of hours there going through the notes and discussing what the site would be. When we finished we both left excited about our first real idea, and soon got stuck into the design and development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a couple of months, we had an initial design, some code and a clearer view of the path ahead, including how we'd monetise the site. We were making progress, things were taking shape. Remarkably we were still just as excited as that day at the pub by the stream. What happened next definitely wasn't expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying that when I had the idea, I did a quick Google to see if it already existed. You know, the 'Facebook for reading' search and then look at the top 3 results. But that's about as far as it went. &lt;em&gt;I wasn't looking for a competitor, so I didn't find one.&lt;/em&gt; We took this brief research as enough to say it hadn't been done and ploughed on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, now a couple months into development, Mike raised the question about whether this really hadn't been done before. We'd spent the last couple months working on this idea, but our initial research was limited at best. I told Mike that I’d done some research and hadn't found anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike did a quick Google. Oh crap. It's been done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there it was. Shelfari. Someone had done this already. We were late to the party. Very late as it turns out. Shelfari had launched 3 years earlier. And not only that, but they'd been acquired by Amazon too. Dammit. This idea &lt;em&gt;was awesome&lt;/em&gt;. But we'd missed the boat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That sucked. We'd dreamed of our idea for months now and invested a good amount of time and effort into it. But it had been done, the dream was over, time to move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back on it, there were a number of issues with our approach. First, there was the whole OTT &lt;em&gt;list all the must have launch features&lt;/em&gt;. Then there was the locking ourselves away for months on end with our secretive idea, hoping one day we would be ready for the big unveil and that everyone would love it as much as we did. But the biggest issue was the fact that we gave up after finding out it had been done already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then we’ve learnt an important lesson:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;New isn’t important. Better is. Significantly better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="how-can-we-make-this-better"&gt;How can we make this better?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When considering a problem to solve, or an idea to work on, we shouldn’t be asking "are we the first to do this?" but “how is this problem currently being solved? How can we solve it &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new twist? A new package? Reworking a successful formula to be more applicable? More frictionless? Easier to access?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an idea to be worth working on you need to see the core of the problem already being solved, with at least some success. If your idea is going to be successful it will already have been done, somewhere, somehow. Your job is reshaping, repackaging and restarting it to capture a different need than currently applied to, or better capture an existing one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing other people already working on a similar problem isn’t just a non-issue, it's essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="whats-the-key-job-your-users-are-trying-to-get-done"&gt;What’s the key job your users are trying to get done?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://blog.intercom.io/using-job-stories-design-features-ui-ux/"&gt;Jobs To Be Done (JTBD) framework&lt;/a&gt; forms everything around one question, "what job is our user trying to get done here?". Are they trying to see their notifications so they can make sure they haven’t missed a message about an item they’re selling? It cuts to the core of what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principles behind the JTBD framework can be applied to us when we’re working out whether an idea has legs. We should be looking to boil our core problem down to one key &lt;em&gt;job to be done&lt;/em&gt;. Once we have this job, we can search to find out how people are solving this problem already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you’re looking to create a new app that scans and stores receipts, then you should be looking at how people are using tools like Evernote to solve this problem already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How are they using Evernote to keep track? Why are they using Evernote? What steps do they have to take? What’s good about this solution? What’s bad?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/mijustin"&gt;Justin Jackson&lt;/a&gt; shares one way of finding answers to these questions: searching the places where people will likely be complaining about the issues they find. A great place to start is on Twitter. Searches like "Evernote problem" will give you a great starting point on some of the issues people are facing with Evernote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If people aren’t trying to solve this problem already, and dissatisfied with their solution, then this isn’t a problem worth solving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="for-us-we-want-to-help-businesses-know-where-their-money-is-going"&gt;For us, we want to help businesses know where their money is going.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day I was chatting to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sethlouey"&gt;Seth Louey&lt;/a&gt; about the problem we’re trying to solve with &lt;a href="https://prodigo.co/"&gt;Prodigo&lt;/a&gt;, seeing whether he experienced the problem and if he did, how he currently solved it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seth did have this problem, and pointed us to the tool he was currently using. From there we found other similar solutions, also trying to solve the problem of tracking where you’re spending your money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My initial reaction was "oh it’s been done. Why are we working on this again?".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I still want to be the genius who sweeps in with an amazing solution to a problem that no-one has ever thought of and will totally redefine a whole industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally I want to feel like I’m the only one clever enough to have thought about this problem and proposed such an amazing solution. I want a blank space, I don’t want competitors already trying to solve this problem. I want it easy. Glorious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully it was at this point I remembered our previous experience with our ‘Facebook for book readers’ idea, and what we’ve learnt since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that people are already trying to solve this problem isn’t a problem, it’s essential if we’re to have any success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only reason to look at completion is to find out 'do people care about this?’. Then go on and solve it better than anyone else for your audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s what we’re going to do.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It had happened again. We had failed, again. Just over two years ago, we had tried to create a website builder specifically aimed at plumbers. But after working on it for over three months, we threw in the towel. Yet again we'd failed to launch anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why were we so hopeless at launching?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="tell-someone"&gt;Tell Someone&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting goals can be powerful. You set your mind on getting into shape each new year, and for the first few weeks you do quite well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, your progress falls away, the habit doesn't stick and you go back to your old ways. Until next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we increase our chances of following through on our goals? Thankfully there's one relatively simple step you can take that's proven to significantly increase your chances of following through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tell someone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing your goal with others is powerful. As soon as you tell someone you're going to do something, your inner desire to be true to your word kicks in. This inner drive then competes with your procrastinating, lazy, Homer Simpson drive, and oftentimes wins, leading you to override your old habits and achieve your goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The science backs this up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"Prompting people to monitor their progress can help them to achieve their goals, but some methods of monitoring are better than others. Specifically, we would recommend that people be encouraged to record, report or make public what they find out as they assess their progress."
&lt;cite&gt;Psychological Bulletin, Vol 142(2), Feb 2016, 198-229.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="regular-public-goals-are-super-powerful"&gt;Regular public goals are super powerful&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nbashaw"&gt;Nathan Bashaw&lt;/a&gt; shared a video where he talked about &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS6-B_eFF-Q"&gt;the power of regular, public goals&lt;/a&gt; and it really resonated with me. He explains how not only are regular, public goals beneficial for you, but they also help to set expectations for your audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your audience knows that each week or month you’re going to deliver, they know you’re taking this seriously, and can decide whether they want to get involved. Much better than simply saying "sign up to hear when I’ve got something to say."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the key:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Regular goals are powerful, public goals are powerful and regular, public goals are &lt;em&gt;super powerful&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, this was a key lesson we had to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="how-we-went-from-never-launching-to-launching-six-projects-in-eight-months-due-to-regular-public-goals"&gt;How we went from never launching to launching six projects in eight months due to regular public goals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important changes we made after our latest failure a couple years back was to get serious with deadlines. To stop messing around working on projects with no real end in sight, but instead to set short-term, regular, attainable deadlines for shipping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'd grown so tired of continually failing to launch that we were desperate. We knew this was a lesson that we had to ingrain deep into the core of how we worked, so rather than aim to launch one project in one month, we set ourselves the goal of launching &lt;a href="https://blog.wearecontrast.com/introducing-sixbysix-217d608362#.jeqjudq9a"&gt;six projects in six months&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of setting this goal we decided to share our progress, blogging regularly about how we were getting on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, these two ingredients, setting regular goals and sharing them, were the single biggest changes we made, and they have had a huge impact on our productivity since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since setting that goal we've launched &lt;a href="https://wearecontrast.com/"&gt;9 new projects&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://learningtolaunch.co/"&gt;a book that shares what we learnt from the whole process&lt;/a&gt;, nearly all of that whilst working full-time jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're now able to launch &lt;a href="https://blog.wearecontrast.com/make-stuff-ff82f78cf5a9#.i7ilu5kan"&gt;new side projects from scratch over a weekend&lt;/a&gt; when previously we'd spend months and have nothing to show for it at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re nothing special. Others have done this with far greater success than us. Just look at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio"&gt;Pieter Levels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Levels set himself a goal to launch &lt;a href="https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/"&gt;12 startups in 12 months&lt;/a&gt; a few months before we set out on our goal. How'd he do? He's now on ~$30k MRR from these projects. Not bad if you ask me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't speak for Levels, but I know for us, the combination of setting regular goals and sharing them publicly drastically increased our output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regular public goals have been super powerful.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="but-now-its-time-to-up-my-game"&gt;But now, it’s time to up my game&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a few months and here I am, ready to take the next step. To step out with my latest, regular, public goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal this time? Writing. I want to write more. As well as this, Mike and I are also starting a new podcast in the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's no good saying we'll podcast when we want – we have to set ourselves regular goals. The same goes with my writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's why, for both these goals, we're committing to shipping weekly. Every week we'll ship a podcast episode. Every week, I'll ship a new blog post. Every week, we'll have people waiting to receive our &lt;a href="https://wearecontrast.com/"&gt;weekly email in their inbox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here I am, telling you. Telling you we're about to do something we've never done before, and do it regularly. Pretty intimidated by that fact, as I write this on my train home from my day job. Scared we'll flop publicly and make a fool of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I know the power of regular public goals, so I'll harness it for all its worth. It's time to step out again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="where-do-you-want-to-be"&gt;Where do you want to be?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where do you want to be in six months time? What do you need to change in order to get there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's time to get serious. I challenge you: set at least one regular, attainable goal this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write a blog post &lt;em&gt;and share it&lt;/em&gt;. Or if that's too much, hit reply to this post and let &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd love to hear it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The other week &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@mijustin"&gt;Justin Jackson&lt;/a&gt; shared a quote, one that I desperately needed to hear. It was from a &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@pjrvs"&gt;Paul Jarvis&lt;/a&gt; post, with the basic premise that &lt;a href="https://medium.pjrvs.com/success-is-for-the-lucky-579e30576eb2#---0-112.sqaw038a0"&gt;success is no scientific endeavour&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is the only common thread with successful entrepreneurs: they keep trying different ideas until one sticks.
&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/756736947926827010"&gt;@mijustin on twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No-one likes to feel like they don’t have a clue what they’re doing. But that’s pretty much what starting a startup is like 24/7. Every day you wake up, and work on a bunch of tasks you were never trained to do. You attempt to solve a bunch of questions that you’ve never answered before. None of us really know what we’re doing, but it never looks like that. You look up at those who’ve experienced success, and wonder, do they have something I don’t?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparing ourselves to others isn’t the answer. Sure, it’s great to learn lessons from those we admire, but expecting to be able to compare the inside view of me now, at this point in the journey, to those towards the top, towards the peak of theirs, is never going to be much use other than to stress us out and demotivate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key to success isn’t having everything together with a five year plan of how you’re going to take over the world, but rather, it’s not letting the unknown, the new, put you off from moving forwards, instead using that as fuel, pushing you forwards into your next adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s not ok to feel like you’re blagging your way through your startup. It’s essential. Anything else is delusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no rules, you see. There are only best practices, that apply sometimes, not others, and evolve over time. It’s great to learn the basic rules of the game, but these will only serve to give you blurry guideposts to prompt further thought. There are no easily digestible ‘unpack and add water’ tips that will immediately push your startup forwards. There are just a bunch of ideas that have worked in the past and will probably give you a rough nudge in the right direction when you’re unsure which path you should be on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re all fumbling forwards in the darkness, desperately trying to find the path forwards. And most of the time we don’t even know where forwards is, with nothing more than a very general sense of direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your ducks will never be in order. You don’t one day graduate from startup school and receive a nice simple business where all the questions are answered and the path forwards is easy, simple and clear. The view from the top isn’t what it looks like from down here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t have less problems as you go forwards, you just have a different set. You graduate from one set of problems to the next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re like us, searching for the right problem to solve and product to build, then listening, brainstorming, testing and iterating are huge. Later, should we get there, customer service, scaling, hiring and leading likely await. Each step has its own challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I feel pretty lame about where we’re at. We’re committed to &lt;a href="https://prodigo.co/"&gt;starting our own startup&lt;/a&gt;, and it being successful, but we don’t even know if what we’re working on now will be what we’re working on in three months time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we’re learning. Learning about the audience we want to serve, about problems we enjoy solving, about ourselves. That’s all that can be said. We’re in a better place now than we were six months ago, that’s what matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Progress is incremental, remember that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re struggling with your startup, understand you’re not alone. Be sure to get accountable with where you’re at. I highly recommend joining a mastermind group that meets weekly to discuss current successes, failures and issues. If you’re not in one already, having this accountability, support, and outside perspective will be huge for you and your business. Reach out to a few like minded people on a similar path to you and see if they’re up for it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But most of all, don’t be ashamed of where you’re at, or what you’re doing. Be like us, just skeletons with flesh doing laps around the sun, desperately trying to work out what on earth we’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you struggling to keep on top of your startups monthly recurring expenses? We were, that’s why we’re building &lt;a href="https://prodigo.co/"&gt;prodigo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prodigo is a simple app that gives you actionable insights into the tools and services you’re paying for.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re early stage and would love to shape this with you. If you’re interested you can sign up at &lt;a href="https://prodigo.co/"&gt;prodigo.co&lt;/a&gt; ✍️  or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FredRivett"&gt;say hi and we can chat&lt;/a&gt; 👋&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A week ago &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marckohlbrugge"&gt;Marc Köhlbrugge&lt;/a&gt; released a neat little side project. The premise was simple, pay to get featured on the site. We’ve seen this before, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/"&gt;The million dollar homepage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The twist here? The more you pay, the higher you’ll be featured on the leaderboard. This gamified the system, with individuals and companies paying more and more for the highest position. Marc managed to use his existing networks to bring the initial burst of traffic through, and pretty soon the ball was well and truly rolling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want some traffic to your site now would be a good time to participate: &lt;a href="https://highscore.money/"&gt;http://highscore.money&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you want some traffic to your site now would be a good time to participate: &lt;a href="https://highscore.money/"&gt;http://highscore.money&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marckohlbrugge?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@marckohlbrugge on twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And by the end of the day Marc had done &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@marckohlbrugge/how-i-made-2-251-in-1-day-with-highscore-money-dd56b35b2681#.i58k99t77"&gt;pretty well&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sort of project clearly comes under the silly little side projects umbrella. It was an opportunistic attempt to make a quick buck, whilst providing value to those who paid for a slot and having fun along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As makers, quick side projects like this help flex our creative muscles. I don’t think Marc intended this to be a fully fledged business, he’s already focussed in on his main gig, BetaList, but that didn’t stop him spending a few days creating this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst following Marc’s launch day progress, one tweet from Marc struck me, and got me thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What's a good, privacy-friendly real-time website counter?
&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marckohlbrugge/status/737388891246891008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@marckohlbrugge on twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the second time I’d seen a request for some form of user facing site stats. A few weeks before, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin"&gt;Justin Jackson&lt;/a&gt; had written &lt;a href="https://justinjackson.ca/webmaster/"&gt;I’m a fucking webmaster&lt;/a&gt;, and wrote &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11685868"&gt;this comment on his Hacker News post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;BTW: does anyone know of a lightweight, retro “hit counter” that can grab my GA stats and display them at the bottom?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pattern was forming here, enough for me to mention to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mikeaag"&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt; that this might be something for us to explore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike and I have been working on side projects for years, but only recently have we got into the habit of actually launching them. Having set ourselves the challenge to launch &lt;a href="https://blog.wearecontrast.com/introducing-sixbysix-217d608362#.gpqkok2i1"&gt;six projects in six months&lt;/a&gt; at the end of 2014, we’ve launched &lt;a href="https://www.producthunt.com/@mikeaag/collections/i-made-that"&gt;8 side projects since&lt;/a&gt;, including writing our first book about the whole process, &lt;a href="https://learningtolaunch.co/"&gt;Learning to Launch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently though, we’ve been focussing on thinking through problems we want to solve, areas of tech we’re interested in, potential markets we’d enjoy helping. We’ve been thinking a lot about the startup we want to build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to get stuck in analysis paralysis. It’s important that we keep moving forwards. That’s why, this past weekend, we spent most of it hacking together a small side project, inspired by Marc’s tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="introducing-real-time-users"&gt;Introducing Real Time Users&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you’ve gotta have some fun and build stuff. That’s what Marc did, and that’s what we decided to do, too. Real Time Users is a little side project that makes us smile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real Time Users is vulnerable, it exposes the truth of how popular your site is. Go to it anytime, and you’ll likely be greeted by the fact you’re the only person on the internet there. That’s both beautiful to know, that you are alone on this piece of internet real estate, and, as a creator, leaves me feeling slightly exposed. You know how popular my site is. For us at least, that’s a new level of transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Partially inspired by Marc’s leaderboard, we’ve included &lt;a href="https://realtimeusers.bycontrast.co/leaderboard"&gt;one of our own&lt;/a&gt;. If you take the 60 seconds and add Real Time Users to your site, you’ll likely take up one of the top 10 slots, until at least 8 others add it to their sites too. You’ll be able to see whether anyone ever adds this to their site, simply by tracking whether those top 10 slots ever fill up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m proud of it, proud because, having discussed it a few times during the week, we only really got to work on it this past weekend, and by Sunday evening we were pretty much ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a walk with Mike the other night I asked him, how long would it have taken us to launch Real Time Users pre-SixBySix? His answer: &lt;em&gt;we’d have never shipped it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s right &lt;em&gt;(don’t tell him that)&lt;/em&gt;. We wouldn’t have. We would have added feature after feature, built with needless shiny technology, and delayed launching month by month as we strived to build the next Google Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since SixBySix, we’re much quicker to launch, and the quality has improved too. Our first project, &lt;a href="http://howsitgo.in/"&gt;HowsItGoin&lt;/a&gt; took 250 hours to ship. Real Time Users took under 15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what we’ve learnt, these past eighteen months. Ship stuff. Keep moving forwards. Learn as you go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Building and launching stuff is a skill, a habit, a muscle. The more you do it, the better you get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spending the past month or so thinking through what we want to be focussing on, the business we want to build, has been an essential step. But sometimes we need to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FredRivett/status/737384708024238084"&gt;step away from the magic whiteboards&lt;/a&gt; and get back to making stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who knows what’ll come of it.&lt;/p&gt;
