    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;2017 has been the hardest year of my life. It started with an overhang that had been building up in the final moments of 2016, which finally exploded in spectacular style. Most of why this year has been the hardest of my (comparatively easy) life so far is personal and involves others, so I won't go into much detail, but suffice it to say, it's been challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="act-1-we-are-fragile"&gt;Act 1: We are fragile&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A family member had quite serious mental health challenges this year, which put a big strain on both themselves and the family as we tried to support them. Mental health is slowly becoming less taboo to talk about and gladly so, and being a little open about the challenges we've faced is my attempt to play my part in that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know how close to breaking point I was, but it's the closest I've come. When someone in your family goes through fundamental challenges that affects the core of how they think and act it puts a strain on all those close to them, those who love them and want to help, but are often unable to, at least in the quick fix manner we'd like. All we can do is walk alongside them, have patience and do our best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are fragile human beings, more so than we'd like to admit. The whole situation was one of fragile humans trying to help fragile humans and in doing so almost breaking themselves. A big lesson I've learnt is that we have to look after ourselves. I have to look after myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They advise adults to fit their oxygen mask before their child's for good reason. We desire to fit the child's mask first but in doing so we risk damaging ourselves into a state where we can't help at all. There's no bravery in running ourselves into the ground trying to help others. We must take care of ourselves, at least keeping our head above water, so we can continue to help others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the storm was at its strongest, I had no choice but to take time out. I started a daily habit of meditation, deliberately taking time for myself to slow down, breathe and just be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, along with being brutally honest with two close friends, was the best thing I did. When things are tough it's super important to spread the weight as much as possible, and simply talking about the issues helps ease the pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside this, I found out I had a growth and would need surgery. Having never been knocked out before I was a pretty apprehensive. Would I wake up? What if something went wrong? Thankfully nothing did, and I can't speak highly enough of the surgeons, nurses and doctors who helped me this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running alongside this were further serious issues that came out of the blue that aren't appropriate to go into here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three of the biggest challenges of my life hit all at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The year was so damn brutal, being attacked on every side at once, that in one sense I couldn't help but laugh and applaud 2017 for being so outrageously co-ordinated in its attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="not even mad" src="https://media.makeameme.org/created/im-not-even-okwpfs.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="act-2-im-off-to-see-the-world"&gt;Act 2: I'm off to see the world&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all the challenges this year, we came through them as a family and the second half of the year I have been ridiculously blessed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A goal I set at the start of the year was to visit a new continent. I've wanted to explore the world and have my eyes opened to new cultures for over 4 years. This year, after recovering from surgery, I finally got myself together and headed for Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've spent the past 12 weeks moving around 7 countries, meeting lots of different folks, eating lots of different food and seeing lots of different cultures. I realise I am beyond blessed to be able to travel and work at the same time and try daily to not take it for granted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I was quite apprehensive about travel. I'm naturally introverted and despite being far from socially awkward, I am more comfortable in the company of good friends or on my own, than chit chat with strangers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feared that travel, with the constant flow of new people, would be overwhelming, and that despite my dreams, I would in fact quickly realise it wasn't the idyllic picture I'd painted and I'd swiftly return to England and my comfort zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully I've thoroughly enjoyed it so far. Yes, there are challenges, there are things I miss, mainly having a group of friends I can "do life" with day to day, but setting off on my travels has been the best decision I've made in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I've come to realise is that solo travel is actually easier for the introvert than the extrovert. As an introvert, you're largely self-sustaining. Everyone needs an element of community, but introverts need it less so than extroverts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've spent the vast majority of my time on my own, exploring cities by walking them whilst listening to an audio book. I've loved being able to set my own schedule, exploring when I'm up for it, resting when I'm not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FredRivett/status/933573040222248960"&gt;I've loved eating when I want, not when I traditionally should&lt;/a&gt;. At one stage I got into the habit of only eating one main meal a day at around 3:30-4:30pm. By this time restaurants are super quiet and there's no queue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've found the time to think and ponder really valuable. When you're on your own you have time to properly grapple with things. Travel has taught me a lot about myself, what I need and what I don't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ending the year at my sisters place in Australia has been perfect. It's been great to spend time with her and her family over Christmas and New Years. Everyone's family is different, but family is an important part of my life. I'm so blessed to have been able to spend the end of the year here making memories with those I love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="progress-but-slower-than-id-like"&gt;Progress (but slower than I'd like)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big part of my life right now is working towards financial freedom, where our business supports both &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/mikeaag"&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt; and myself. We've made progress this year launching &lt;a href="http://usercompass.com/"&gt;UserCompass&lt;/a&gt; and gaining our first couple of paying customers. Things have moved slower than I'd like though, which is partially due to the challenges at the start of the year, and the travels in the second half. Mike has also been working full time, which has slowed things quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike has now left his full-time job and we'll both be focussing on the business this year. My challenge will be balancing a bit of client work to cover costs, some travel and the focus on our work. It's a good problem to have though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area I've been experimenting with is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FredRivett"&gt;daily tweetlogging, or twogging for short&lt;/a&gt;. I'm still not entirely sold on the idea, but hope that over time the thread will become an interesting insight into the day to day of building a business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="a-few-highlights-from-2017"&gt;A few highlights from 2017&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id="places"&gt;Places:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Greece: Earlier in the year I was fortunate to spend 2 weeks on a small Greek island. I loved how relaxed it was, being able to get to know the locals was a nice change from most holidays. It's here I decided I'd set off for Asia.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Japan (Tokyo + Kyoto especially): This is a mysterious place to me, with great food and a unique culture. To sum it up in one line: The ATMs are from the 80's and the toilets are from the future.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hong Kong and Taipei: Two cities with a mix of amazing food and beautiful landscapes. I hope to return to both.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id="books"&gt;Books:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/Bios-Memoirs/Shoe-Dog-Audiobook/B01CRM17MS"&gt;Shoe Dog by Phil Knight&lt;/a&gt;: A great insight into the reality of starting a global brand and the luck required along the way.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/Nonfiction/Ghost-in-the-Wires-Audiobook/B005H3FYR4"&gt;Ghost in the Wires by Kevin Mitnick&lt;/a&gt;: A thrilling insight into the life of one of the worlds most wanted hackers in the 1980's.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/Business/Principles-Audiobook/B074B29GQJ"&gt;Principles by Ray Dalio&lt;/a&gt;: A thought-provoking handbook that challenges long held ideas about how to run a successful company.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/Business/Principles-Audiobook/B074B29GQJ"&gt;Masters of Doom&lt;/a&gt;: A topsy-turvy true story of how two John's revolutionised the gaming industry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="goals-recap--2018-goals"&gt;2017 goals recap &amp;amp; 2018 goals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id="my-goals-for-2017httpfredrivettcom201701012016-a-year-of-learning-were"&gt;&lt;a href="http://fredrivett.com/2017/01/01/2016-a-year-of-learning/"&gt;My goals for 2017&lt;/a&gt; were:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sort out my legs to get running and playing football again.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get a stranger on the internet to pay us a monthly fee for a product we make.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visit a new continent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I achieved 2/3, but again neglected and procrastinated on sorting out my health. It was a high level goal that I never took seriously with day to day actions. This year I'm determined to do what I can to get my legs sorted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike mentioned to me his desire to get running in 2018, and we've both decided to commit to running a 10k in 2018. 10,000 metres isn't far, but for two guys who have hardly ran the past 10 years, it's a goal that's hopefully achievable yet will still be a huge change for us. Whatever it takes, I need to get myself out there and redeem my health. Life's too short to procrastinate on something so important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="my-three-goals-for-2018"&gt;My three goals for 2018:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get my legs sorted so they're strong and healthy (run a 10k)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Support ourselves from product work (napkin maths says around $8k+ MRR)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Travel as much as I can (visit at least 5 new countries)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Six weeks ago I found out that my current contract was coming to an end. Naturally a part of me was sad hearing this, the project's budget was being cut and the product team would be leaving. I'd been working in a small, capable team and enjoyed my work environment. But a big part of me was excited. Excited that I'd finally get some time to dig in and work on building a business of my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/mikeaag"&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt; and I have been working together for over 8 years now, on and off. We started out together back in College (that's school for 16-18 year olds here in the UK) and have worked on a lot of projects together. We started a business straight out of College along with another friend, and we dreamt of supporting ourselves from it. That dream never materialised as we had little clue what we were doing. But through it all we learnt a lot that we took into our next stages in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the business ended we parted ways, Mike started at Essex Uni whilst I headed down to West Sussex. Despite moving apart we still kept in touch and continued to work on side projects together.&lt;a href="https://learningtolaunch.co/read%231-our-backstory"&gt; Just back then we had no idea how to actually launch them.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to two years ago, and I'd left my previous job of three years and was ready to make a change in life. I wanted to focus on two of my passions, front-end development and making things. Mike and I finally got serious about our ambitions, and made a drastic change. Rather than working on whatever we felt like until we felt like it no more, we'd work on&lt;a href="https://blog.wearecontrast.com/introducing-sixbysix-217d608362"&gt; six projects in six months&lt;/a&gt;, looking to launch them all within that month timespan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strangely enough, it worked. We went from zero launches to six in &lt;em&gt;(ahem: just over)&lt;/em&gt; six months. We'd invested a tonne of time (over 1200 hours that year) but we grew a lot. Those projects also led me to land my first job as a front-end developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9 months before, I'd left a job and a life in West Sussex, moving back home to start&lt;a href="https://blog.wearecontrast.com/introducing-sixbysix-217d608362"&gt; SixBySix&lt;/a&gt; and we pushed ourselves to the next level. Now, two years on, it's happening again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="its-time-to-level-up-again"&gt;It's time to level up again&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since we launched our sixth project,&lt;a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/founderskit"&gt; FoundersKit&lt;/a&gt;, back in August 2015, we've been focussed on taking what we've learnt and building a business. &lt;a href="https://learningtolaunch.co/"&gt;But&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://realtimeusers.bycontrast.co/?utm_source=wearecontrast.com"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://hitreply.co/?utm_source=wearecontrast.com"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://storiesasaservice.com/?utm_source=wearecontrast.com"&gt;reasons&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FredRivett/status/792322698546384896"&gt; primarily due to overthinking it all&lt;/a&gt;, we've made slow progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, after a serious dressing down from&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mbuckbee"&gt; Michael Buckbee&lt;/a&gt;, we switched gears and got serious about our goals. Instead of dreaming, planning and hoping, we've started doing. Doing things when we're not exactly sure how it'll work out, or what the path ahead of us looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="im-going-full-time-and-were-on-0nbspmrr"&gt;I'm going full time and we're on $0 MRR&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming back to the title of this post, I'm confronted with a big fat ZERO. ZERO dollars coming into our bank account each month. ZERO customers paying us money. ZERO experience building a B2B SaaS. There's a lot of zero's here, and they aren't preceded by a dollar sign and a one. We're starting from scratch. Or are we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're confronted by the raw facts of the situation. We know that for us this is uncharted ground. We stand here looking up at the blank space we hope our building will one day take up. The potential of &lt;em&gt;what can be&lt;/em&gt;, what I believe &lt;em&gt;will be&lt;/em&gt;, excites me to the core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That excitement, mixed in with a healthy dose of nerves, is my fuel for this mission. We're building on what we've learnt&lt;a href="https://wearecontrast.com/"&gt; shipping 11 projects the past 2 years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike, for now (and the foreseeable future), remains full-time, he'll be building out our tech on the side. In the meantime, each day I'll be doing everything I can to get this business off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means reaching out to everyone I can who I think will benefit from our product. That means reaching out to customers, listening to customers, designing the UI &amp;amp; UX, coding the front-end, and working with Mike to guide the product forwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm excited by this challenge. I've set myself a goal of reaching out to 10 business every day. Emails, phone calls, meetups, this is the bread and butter of our initial customer acquisition plan. This is also the thing I naturally enjoy the least. Time to expand the comfort zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This journey will have ups and downs. As&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanaoneil/"&gt; Ryan Oneil&lt;/a&gt; recently put it, we will "respect the curvy ascent."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn't a jetpack to our freedom, but one way or another, we'll find our way there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="how-you-can-keep-up-to-date"&gt;How you can keep up to date&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interested in following along for the journey? The best way to do so is to&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FredRivett/"&gt; follow along on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. Inspired by&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sethlouey/status/859019760956317697"&gt; Seth Louey&lt;/a&gt;, each day I'll be posting up a 140 character summary of what I did that day and how things are going. It's gonna be one hell of a ride.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;2016 has been a year with good moments and bad moments. Overall, it wasn't my favourite year, but despite some sadness in how it's gone, there's been a lot to be thankful for. That's what I'll focus on in this years review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this review I cover:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Books I've read and listened to and my thoughts on each.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How our side projects have gone.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Places I've visited.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fitness update.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Best purchases of the year.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A few of my goals for 2017.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="books"&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year Mike and I both decided to try out listening to audio books. I spend a fair amount of time commuting to and from work, which makes audio books ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of that I also bought a Kindle and enjoyed reading both to unwind at night and to relax when travelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the books I read and listened to in 2016, and my brief thoughts on each:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="books-ive-read-7"&gt;Books I've read (7)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0165X8WN2/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;btkr=1"&gt;When Breath Becomes Air&lt;/a&gt; by Paul Kalanithi&lt;br /&gt;
★★★★½ — &lt;em&gt;Superbly written, humbling read about a man taken before his time. Recommended.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Naked-Economics-Undressing-Science-Revised-ebook/dp/B003NX6TYC/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1482832677&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=naked+economics"&gt;Naked Economics&lt;/a&gt; by Charles Wheelan and Burton G. Malkiel&lt;br /&gt;
★★★★☆ — &lt;em&gt;Nice simple insight into economics, my first foray into the topic and learnt a lot. An important book that gives a pathway for understanding the basics of economics, which more than ever is a hot topic worldwide.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.intercom.com/books/jobs-to-be-done"&gt;Intercom on Jobs-To-Be-Done&lt;/a&gt; by Intercom&lt;br /&gt;
★★★½☆ — &lt;em&gt;A key book for any product person to read, helps to shape how we see the products we create from the viewpoint of the user.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://uibreakfast.com/audit/"&gt;The UI Audit&lt;/a&gt; by Jane Portman&lt;br /&gt;
★★★☆☆ — &lt;em&gt;A nice short read for founders looking to get their head around the basics of their UI. A good guideline and useful resource.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/I-Am-Zlatan-Ibrahimovic-ebook/dp/B00DH4BL4U/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1482832724&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=i+am+zlatan"&gt;I am Zlatan Ibrahimovic&lt;/a&gt; by Zlatan Ibrahimovic&lt;br /&gt;
★★★☆☆ — &lt;em&gt;A relatively short autobiography with an interesting insight into one of the bigger characters in world football.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.miraclemorning.com/"&gt;The Miracle Morning&lt;/a&gt; by Hal Elrod&lt;br /&gt;
★★★☆☆ — &lt;em&gt;As with most self-help books, some useful points, all rather obvious but a nice prompt to put them into action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.intercom.com/books/customer-engagement"&gt;Intercom on Customer Engagement&lt;/a&gt; by Intercom&lt;br /&gt;
★★½☆☆ — &lt;em&gt;A decent book on an important topic for any product person, but a little premature read for me so it didn't quite stick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="books-i-listened-to-24"&gt;Books I listened to (24)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016 I listened to 24 audio books, with a total listening time of over 202 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Ready-Player-One-Unabridged-Part-1-Audiobook/B007PR58RQ"&gt;Ready Player One&lt;/a&gt; by Ernest Cline &lt;em&gt;(15h 40m)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
★★★★½ — &lt;em&gt;Captivating throughout, had me listening intently and thinking about it when not. Despite not being much of a fiction man, this was my favourite book of 2016.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Deep-Work-Unabridged-Audiobook/B01D0E32T8"&gt;Deep Work&lt;/a&gt; by Cal Newport &lt;em&gt;(7h 44m)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
★★★★☆ — &lt;em&gt;An important piece for a society that has little time for focus. Not just theory, the author shares how the tactics he espouses have had a direct, positive impact on what he has achieved and how he has lived whilst doing so. Recommended.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

★★★★☆ — &lt;em&gt;The first book of the year and a great one to start on. A very accessible book on how the brain works, shedding light on some of our more irrational behaviours. Has helped me to gain greater control of my thoughts and behaviour.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

★★★☆☆ — &lt;em&gt;A collection of useful tips on how to improve our business lives, yet due to the scattered nature of the book didn't leave me with notable takeaways.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Business/Purple-Cow-Audiobook/B004EW53FM"&gt;Purple Cow&lt;/a&gt; by Seth Godin &lt;em&gt;(2h 58m)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
★★★☆☆ — &lt;em&gt;A simple book that drives home one important message, marketing is all about standing out from the crowd.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Mans-Search-for-Meaning-Unabridged-Audiobook/B004EVQKKK"&gt;Man's Search For Meaning&lt;/a&gt; by Victor E. Frankl &lt;em&gt;(4h 47m)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
★★½☆☆ — &lt;em&gt;An important topic, but quite monotonous at times and tough to stick with. Potentially says more about my attention span than the books content.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Business/People-over-Profit-Audiobook/B00WFINV4W"&gt;People over Profit&lt;/a&gt; by Dale Partridge &lt;em&gt;(3h 5m)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
★★☆☆☆ — &lt;em&gt;A decent message but the book didn't captivate. Nothing offensive but never offering anything too notable, won't be rushing to recommend.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="side-projects"&gt;Side projects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the turn of the year &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/mikeaag"&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt; and I were half way through writing our book, Learning To Launch, and had ambitions to focus on one project, in an attempt to move from simply launching side projects to building a business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The year didn't quite take the shape we'd hoped it to, but we made progress nevertheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="learning-to-launchhttplearningtolaunchco-the-book"&gt;&lt;a href="http://learningtolaunch.co/"&gt;Learning To Launch&lt;/a&gt; (the book)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out writing a book isn't all that easy. We kinda knew that before embarking on it, but now we &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that in a more tangible way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After writing over 20,000 words, we deleted almost half of it and ended up shipping the book at the end of March. It &lt;a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/learning-to-launch"&gt;went down well on Product Hunt&lt;/a&gt; but wasn't a project we intended to heavily focus on, and as a result we haven't pushed it much since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a cycle we've been in for a while, one we purposefully put ourselves into a couple of years ago to get us into the habit of shipping, and is one we're now looking to level up on, shipping still, but then growing a product from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing the book was a goal in and of itself for us, and I'm glad we did it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="real-time-users"&gt;Real Time Users&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June we launched &lt;a href="https://realtimeusers.bycontrast.co/?ref=producthunt"&gt;Real Time Users&lt;/a&gt;. Having launched 8 tech projects in 2015, RTU was our only tech launch of 2016. RTU was inspired by a couple of comments from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marckohlbrugge"&gt;Marc Köhlbrugge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/mijustin"&gt;Justin Jackson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We built and launched it in a weekend, primarily to get back into the swing of things, and it felt good to ship something again. We also learnt a good amount about the basics of running our own analytics app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.wearecontrast.com/make-stuff-ff82f78cf5a9#.jtmt05woe"&gt;You can read the story behind Real Time Users here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="mastermind"&gt;Mastermind&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've appreciated the benefits of community and accountability for a while, it played a big part in our (comparative) success of 2015. This year I took it up a notch and joined a mastermind group. We meet up online each Monday night for an hour and check in on our successes and failures from the past week, and what our goal(s) are for the week to come. We also have a rotating hotseat, that gives one person each week a chance to go deep on a topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since joining the mastermind earlier this year I've already seen superb results, with each member making good, if not great progress towards their goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With it being our first half year together, I'm excited to see where we go individually and collectively in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-podcast"&gt;The podcast&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest projects we undertook in 2016 was starting up a new podcast, &lt;a href="http://hitreply.co/"&gt;Hit Reply&lt;/a&gt;. We started it with the aim of creating a high quality, relatively short podcast to help founders get an inside view at another startup, from pre-launch through to scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, after getting 8 episodes in, and receiving listening numbers far higher than we expected (over 4,500 listens), we realised this wasn't a good fit for us. Each episode was taking up nearly all our time that week, and the audience we were building wasn't one we wanted to focus on in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, we stopped the podcast to focus on other endeavours. That said, it might be something I'd look to revisit in the future. There's certainly some benefits to podcasting over other content methods like blogging, and with &lt;a href="https://www.producthunt.com/podcasts"&gt;Product Hunt&lt;/a&gt; promoting podcast episodes it's an interesting avenue to explore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="sold-founderskithttpfounderskitco"&gt;Sold &lt;a href="http://founderskit.co/"&gt;FoundersKit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/founderskit"&gt;Having launched FoundersKit over 16 months earlier&lt;/a&gt;, we decided it wasn't a project we wanted to pursue. It didn't really fit with our plans moving forwards and we knew it would work better in someone else's hands. We reached out to Leon at Startup Foundation in early December and happily agreed for him to acquire FoundersKit a few weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;note: As part of the deal, FoundersKit has been rebranded to Startup Deals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="relaunched-fredrivettcom"&gt;Relaunched fredrivett.com&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a prompt from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tranhelen"&gt;Helen Tran&lt;/a&gt;, I finally got round to launching a new site for myself, &lt;a href="http://fredrivett.com/"&gt;fredrivett.com&lt;/a&gt;. It's a simple setup, with &lt;a href="https://middlemanapp.com/"&gt;Middleman&lt;/a&gt; generating static files and hosting them on Github pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="weeks-straight-of-weekly-blogging"&gt;21 weeks straight of weekly blogging&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August I set out to up my writing game, and set myself the challenge of publishing weekly. On top of hitting publish, I started sending a small email to our list with a heads up about the new post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've definitely improved as a writer in that time, or at least in my ability to actually write. I now find it easier to sit down at my laptop, collect my thoughts and write a post. There's a real benefit to regularly taking a mind dump. It always brings more clarity to my thoughts and I often find things in there that I wasn't consciously aware of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if it's a goal I'll continue in 2017, but I want to continue to take a seed of a thought and expand it out to see what else is there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="spent-way-too-long-trying-to-do-it-right"&gt;Spent way too long trying to do it &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of all though, &lt;a href="http://fredrivett.com/2016/10/03/am-i-doing-it-right/"&gt;we spent way too long trying to do it right&lt;/a&gt;. We knew that we had to change tact from 2015, but we ended up swinging the pendulum from "silly little side projects" way too far over to "serious business thing".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wanted to find something we could commit 3, 6, 12 months to, and spent too long trying to find the perfect idea. This part is hard. We did a lot right (we spent a good amount of time working out who we wanted to serve and what we enjoyed doing) but I'm sure we could have cut out a lot of wasted time. Hindsight is beautiful though, and the main thing is we made progress in the end, despite frustrations on the journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="started-contracting"&gt;Started contracting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big change for me was going from permanent work to contracting. In September I left my role of 18 months at &lt;a href="https://store.tpo.com/"&gt;TPO&lt;/a&gt; and signed my first contract with &lt;a href="http://spoke.law/"&gt;Spoke&lt;/a&gt;. It's been a good move for me, taking me into the next step professionally. I'm enjoying working in a small team on an interesting project, being paid to get further experience in the early stages of a new product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, I've been working 4 days a week which has been a nice stepping stone, giving me more time to focus on our side projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="visited-4-countries-10-cities-9-new"&gt;Visited 4 countries (10 cities, 9 new)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="barcelona"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April, I headed out to Barcelona for a quick weekend trip with a couple of friends. We booked everything up on the Friday, flew out Saturday morning and back on Sunday night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main purpose of the flight was a trip to Camp Nou, arguably one of the greatest football stadiums, home to one of the best teams and one of the best players in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's definitely something to be said for quick weekend trips like this, they're a great way to explore new places and make memories without spending too much time or money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="valencia"&gt;Valencia&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, after the success of the Barcelona trip, a couple of us headed out to Valencia for a long weekend. The Airbnb we booked was new and hadn't any reviews, so it was a bit of a risk. Fortunately it turned out to be a great shout, with the flat, host and location (opposite Valencia beach) perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made sure to catch a game at the famous Mestalla stadium, home to the steepest stands in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="paris-lyon--st-etienne"&gt;Paris, Lyon &amp;amp; St Etienne&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, we headed out to France for Euro 2016. We started up in Paris, heading to the fanzone under the Eiffel tower. On the day of England Wales we arrived in central Paris early in the day England shirts on show. Unfortunately we didn't plan for a downpour, and got totally soaked. Straight from there we headed to the fanzone, where the fans were embracing the wet weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few days in Paris, we got an overnight coach (an experience) down to Lyon. We spent a few days there, heading down to St Etienne to watch England Slovakia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it was great to visit Lyon and St Etienne, two new cities for me, and experience the tournament atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="berlin"&gt;Berlin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September I headed out to Berlin, my first visit to the capital of Germany. I met up with a few friends out there and enjoyed getting a grasp of both the historical and current sides of this great city. Will certainly return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="san-francisco-la-san-diego--new-york"&gt;San Francisco, LA, San Diego &amp;amp; New York&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October Mike and I headed out for a Californian road trip with a few days in New York on the way back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We landed in San Francisco, spent 4 days in the city and the Bay Area. I enjoyed cycling the Golden Gate Bridge over to Sausalito, a beautiful little town just ten minutes away from the city. Stanford was a superb experience too, a real world class place to study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After San Francisco, we spent 3 days driving down the coast through Big Sur, before arriving at LA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We only spent a couple of days in LA, but more than enough time to have a few stories that we won't be forgetting in a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After LA, we drove down to San Diego, staying the night in La Jolla, a beautiful little area on the outskirts of San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day we flew from San Diego to New York. With it being our first time in New York, we spent most of it seeing the sights and being a nondescript tourist. A cool city, one I plan to visit again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="fitness"&gt;Fitness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2016 was a decent year for fitness. I definitely made progress, if nothing remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the turn of the year I'd put on a bit of unwanted weight, so decided to try out Intermittent Fasting. I didn't follow any specific version of IF, simply skipping breakfast and lunch on Tuesdays and Thursdays, effectively creating two 24 hour windows where I didn't eat each week (dinner 'til dinner).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people speak of health benefits to IF beyond simple calorie restriction. Personally those health benefits were just a bonus if true, with IF providing a simple way to limit calorie intake either way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally find this method of calorie restriction far easier than more standard diets, as I pretty much ate as I pleased outside of these two periods. Another bonus has been my significantly reduced appetite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 52 weeks of fasting, I'm happy with how it's worked out, having lost a good amount of body fat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside fasting I swam on and off and stepped up doing bodyweight exercises (read: chin ups and push ups).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having started the year unable to do a chin up, I can now do 10 in a row, which just goes to show the progress that can be made with a little effort every now and then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the progress, I've still got some way to go with some of my fitness goals, namely to get running and playing football again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="best-purchases-this-year"&gt;Best purchases this year&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm generally quite frugal with my money, only buying something when I know I want it and will benefit from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the three main purchases this year were ones I'd thought about for months before deciding to take the plunge. I'm happy with all three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="bose-qc35"&gt;Bose QC35&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bose.co.uk/en_gb/products/headphones/over_ear_headphones/quietcomfort-35-wireless.html"&gt;These headphones are very good&lt;/a&gt;. The sound quality is decent, certainly good enough yet nothing remarkable, but combined with the excellent noise cancelling these are superb headphones for anyone who's regularly in noisy environments (think commuting and open plan offices).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefit of getting a bit of headspace is hard to put into money. The fact these headphones are wireless is a really nice touch too. Very happy with these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="kindle-paperwhite"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been wanting to get a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Amazon-Kindle-Paperwhite-6-Inch-4GB-E-Reader/dp/B00QJDO0QC"&gt;Kindle&lt;/a&gt; for a little while, but the stack of paper books at the side of my bed has kept me from rushing out to get one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016 I finally got involved and I'm very happy I did. The reading experience is great. Primarily due to the distraction free nature of the device, mimicking the paper counterpart, coupled with the portability and a few little niceties. I particularly enjoy the subtle backlight and reading stats (% through book, minutes left in chapter).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="fitbit-flex-2"&gt;Fitbit Flex 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final purchase of note was a &lt;a href="https://www.fitbit.com/uk/flex2"&gt;Fitbit Flex 2&lt;/a&gt; in November. Mike's been a Fitbit fan since the summer and with the Flex 2 release I was happy to jump on the bandwagon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Flex 2 is my type of wearable: minimal. I'm not a watch wearer so this little device has been a good stepping stone. I'm also looking forward to testing out the swim mode in the new year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="looking-ahead-to-2017"&gt;Looking ahead to 2017&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've not yet fully thought out my goals for 2017, but here's a few I want to target:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sort out my legs to get running and playing football again.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get a stranger on the internet to pay us a monthly fee for a product we make.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visit a new continent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've got a fair few stretch goals, and a few personal goals on top of this, but if I only achieve those three it won't have been a bad year.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“People travel to wonder
at the height of the mountains,
at the huge waves of the seas,
at the long course of the rivers,
at the vast compass of the ocean,
at the circular motion of the stars,
and yet they pass by themselves
without wondering.”&lt;br /&gt;
— Saint Augustine of Hippo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn't it remarkable how little we're truly ourselves. We're often so afraid that anyone will see us as we see ourselves that we wear masks and project our best version at every available opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As humans we are prone to over analysing how others see us. Ever noticed how we pay so much attention to one negative comment but ignore ten positive ones? We're desperate to know what people &lt;em&gt;really think&lt;/em&gt;. Are they telling the truth whilst the others are just saying what I want to hear?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's easy to sugarcoat everything we do in an attempt to avoid judgement and criticism, to stop the negative comments having a chance to outweigh the positive ones. No place is this more prevalent than on Facebook. Every post shows the side we want to show, whilst our Instagram feed paints a picture of how wonderful our life is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, most people just want to fit in. To be a part of the crowd, to never stand out. That's fine, but it's not how you build a business. It's not how you draw an audience. It's not how you make deep friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a business to ever work it has to stand out. That is the whole premise of marketing. The ability to gain attention by being different to your competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For friendship to work, you have to be real. No-one wants to be friends with the average of everyone's perceived socially acceptable human being. No-one has 2.5 kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respect and admiration are built upon appreciating the similarities and differences we have. This is true both in business and in life. Some of my best friends are markedly different to me. I've learnt so much from these people. Heck, we even named our business Contrast in reference to the fact &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/mikeaag"&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt; and I are so different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everyone will like you or agree with you, and that's fine. You will be wrong sometimes, make mistakes, and be human. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FredRivett/status/761484340417167361?lang=en"&gt;You are a work in progress, after all&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's important we try to be real. To be us. People buy from those they trust and they trust those who are real. You're far more likely to make a sale if you acknowledge some of the downsides of your offering than if you pretend that everything is perfect. People are wary of perfection, nothing is perfect. If you're up front with the downsides then people will feel they have a better picture of what you're offering and more confidence in the rest of what you're saying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honesty and integrity (being you) then, are good for both business and life. But regardless of this, they're actually healthy. They're freeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not easy, but we don't have to go all in. We need only take baby steps, moving forwards little by little. Evolving and growing over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“You’re a ghost driving a meat coated skeleton made from stardust. What do you have to be afraid of?” — unknown&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all get one shot at life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much better to be loved for who we are than liked for who we're not.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Knowing where you’d like to go is important. It helps us frame the decisions we make now that move us towards where we want to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our book, &lt;a href="https://learningtolaunch.co/"&gt;Learning To Launch&lt;/a&gt;, we described how we strike the balance between the long term and short term:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Have long term goals in mind, and short term goals in focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means knowing where you’re trying to go and having that as a constant reference point in the back of your mind. &lt;strong&gt;A North Star that you use to guide you on the journey.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Mike and I, that North Star is freedom. Freedom from the 9-5. Freedom from selling our time. Free to choose how to spend it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the commitments we have, after doing some napkin maths, we’ve worked out we roughly need to be taking in £100k a year. We’ll likely be selling in dollars, so in reality that will be roughly $120k/year, or $10k MRR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That feels a long way off. We’ve launched &lt;a href="http://wearecontrast.com/"&gt;a few different things&lt;/a&gt; in the past, and &lt;a href="http://founderskit.co/"&gt;one of those&lt;/a&gt; is making a small amount of money, but we don’t have an easy pathway on how we’re going to get from here to there. There are so many unknowns, we’d never be able to predict the path we will take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s ok. Despite that, we’ve taken our best guess at breaking down the big goal into smaller, more attainable goals. Instead of trying to get to financial freedom now, we’re focussed on simply finding a problem that interests us, that we’d like to spend a few months finding out more about and attempting to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say any problem that we’d like to solve will do. There are other checks that have to be met, which fall under the broad heading of “how well placed are we to solve this?”. We’re not attempting to solve world hunger just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge with a goal so seemingly unattainable as financial freedom is that it can cripple us from moving forwards. If we focus too heavily on “will this idea ever earn $10k a month?” then we may never take that step and launch a product that can make us $100 a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to strike the right balance. &lt;a href="http://fredrivett.com/2016/08/29/healthy-pressure/"&gt;Some pressure is healthy&lt;/a&gt;. A little pressure can help bring clarity to what matters, but too much can stop us dead in our tracks. We need a pressure valve that we can tweak to keep us motivated without feeling overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For us, having that smaller, more attainable “find a problem that we’re interested in solving” goal helps lower the pressure. We can chip away at this and see progress take shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we attempt to move towards our goal, progress will never be linear. There will be times when we make great progress, and times when we feel we’re taking two steps forward and three steps back. This up and down journey leads to great highs and low lows, which is why we have to view progress over a greater period of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have I made progress this past six months? This year, 2016, did I move towards where I want to be, or have I stagnated? Am I on the right path, or do I need to make a change?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, as we look back, we’ve not made the progress we’d hoped to. I’m just being honest. We’ve made some, we’re in a better place now than we were twelve months ago, but we’ve wasted too much time going round in circles, &lt;a href="http://fredrivett.com/2016/10/03/am-i-doing-it-right/"&gt;stuck in analysis paralysis&lt;/a&gt;. We’re attempting to learn from that now and not make that same mistake again in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you look back over this year, take time to consider the highs and lows, and take time to think about whether where you want to go has changed, or whether you’ve lost track of your North Star. Recalibrate yourself to live 2017 with intentionality. Set a big ambitious goal and break it down into smaller attainable steps on the journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our plans never stay fully static, they always evolve and change as we move towards them, as they should. But having that North Star to look up to when the times are tough is important, else we wander, round and round, moving, but never actually getting anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Solving problems is at the heart of any great product or business. Behind every shiny product or lightbulb idea is a real problem being solved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When trying to solve a problem, there are two key activities we must undertake, data gathering and data connecting. The more data points you gather, the more you’ll have to connect together to form creative patterns. As Steve Jobs said, &lt;em&gt;“creativity is just connecting things.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to make the best data connections is to collect two types of data, specific and generic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specific data is the information you learn about the problem you’re trying to solve. So if you’re trying to help mechanics improve their day to day life, then you should spend time with some mechanics. Read a variety of mechanics books and magazines. Interview mechanics, asking them a bunch of open ended questions. Soak up all sorts of information about mechanics, why they do what they do, what they enjoy doing, what they dislike doing, what they struggle doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then once you’ve spent enough time getting into the head of the mechanics, you should start to see a pattern emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing this sort of investigating can be fun when you’re in the flow, other times it’s a bit of a drag but you plough on, but either way I find it easy to justify this time as work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other side to data gathering is the generic data points. This can come from anywhere. Reading about anything you’re interested in is a great way to collect generic data. Listening to podcasts or audio books and watching films and documentaries are more great ways to add depth and variety into our general data store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This generic data collection doesn’t feel like work at all, and it isn’t really, it’s just life. But the more non-specific data you collect the more interesting combinations you can make when you come to connect the data points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connecting the data points can happen anytime, anywhere. Often a good amount of this will happen hand in hand with gathering data points. As you’re learning about the people you’re looking to help and the problems they’re experiencing you’ll start to see threads appear between the different data points you’ve been gathering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often though, we need to get away from our normal surroundings to create the best connections. Have you ever noticed how many of our best ideas happen in the shower?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonah Lehrer thinks its to do with quietening ourselves, stopping ourselves from being externally distracted to listen to our subconscious that’s already been making some of these connections:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“…so many insights happen during warm showers. For many people, it’s the most relaxing part of the day. It’s not until we’re being massaged by warm water, unable to check our e-mail, that we’re finally able to hear the quiet voices in the backs of our heads telling us about the insight. The answers have been their all along–we just weren’t listening.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Showers are a classic breeding ground for creative connections, but so are quiet, scenic walks. I find I’m often scribbling down insights (read: tweeting) that come to me as I go for a walk through a local field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But despite this increased creativity, I often find it hard to justify going on these walks, as it doesn’t &lt;em&gt;feel like&lt;/em&gt; work (don’t worry I shower every day). Every step I take outside of my door is a step away from my laptop, where I &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; I should be, &lt;em&gt;being productive&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Doing the work&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s an issue. If I’m to solve the most interesting problems in the most effective, creative ways, then I need to give myself time to breathe. To quieten myself. To not be distracted. I need to take the time to connect the dots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is as much work as data gathering. I have to discipline myself to step away from my laptop and relax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find the balance between focus and quiet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The balance between data gathering and data connecting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That’s because they were able to connect experiences they’ve had and synthesize new things. And the reason they were able to do that was that they’ve had more experiences or they have thought more about their experiences than other people. Unfortunately, that’s too rare a commodity. A lot of people in our industry haven’t had very diverse experiences. So they don’t have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem. The broader one’s understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have.
