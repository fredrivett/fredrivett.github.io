    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The other week &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@mijustin"&gt;Justin Jackson&lt;/a&gt; shared a quote, one that I desperately needed to hear. It was from a &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@pjrvs"&gt;Paul Jarvis&lt;/a&gt; post, with the basic premise that &lt;a href="https://medium.pjrvs.com/success-is-for-the-lucky-579e30576eb2#---0-112.sqaw038a0"&gt;success is no scientific endeavour&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is the only common thread with successful entrepreneurs: they keep trying different ideas until one sticks.
&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/756736947926827010"&gt;@mijustin on twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No-one likes to feel like they don‚Äôt have a clue what they‚Äôre doing. But that‚Äôs pretty much what starting a startup is like 24/7. Every day you wake up, and work on a bunch of tasks you were never trained to do. You attempt to solve a bunch of questions that you‚Äôve never answered before. None of us really know what we‚Äôre doing, but it never looks like that. You look up at those who‚Äôve experienced success, and wonder, do they have something I don‚Äôt?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparing ourselves to others isn‚Äôt the answer. Sure, it‚Äôs great to learn lessons from those we admire, but expecting to be able to compare the inside view of me now, at this point in the journey, to those towards the top, towards the peak of theirs, is never going to be much use other than to stress us out and demotivate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key to success isn‚Äôt having everything together with a five year plan of how you‚Äôre going to take over the world, but rather, it‚Äôs not letting the unknown, the new, put you off from moving forwards, instead using that as fuel, pushing you forwards into your next adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs not ok to feel like you‚Äôre blagging your way through your startup. It‚Äôs essential. Anything else is delusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no rules, you see. There are only best practices, that apply sometimes, not others, and evolve over time. It‚Äôs great to learn the basic rules of the game, but these will only serve to give you blurry guideposts to prompt further thought. There are no easily digestible ‚Äòunpack and add water‚Äô tips that will immediately push your startup forwards. There are just a bunch of ideas that have worked in the past and will probably give you a rough nudge in the right direction when you‚Äôre unsure which path you should be on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôre all fumbling forwards in the darkness, desperately trying to find the path forwards. And most of the time we don‚Äôt even know where forwards is, with nothing more than a very general sense of direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your ducks will never be in order. You don‚Äôt one day graduate from startup school and receive a nice simple business where all the questions are answered and the path forwards is easy, simple and clear. The view from the top isn‚Äôt what it looks like from down here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don‚Äôt have less problems as you go forwards, you just have a different set. You graduate from one set of problems to the next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre like us, searching for the right problem to solve and product to build, then listening, brainstorming, testing and iterating are huge. Later, should we get there, customer service, scaling, hiring and leading likely await. Each step has its own challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I feel pretty lame about where we‚Äôre at. We‚Äôre committed to &lt;a href="https://prodigo.co/"&gt;starting our own startup&lt;/a&gt;, and it being successful, but we don‚Äôt even know if what we‚Äôre working on now will be what we‚Äôre working on in three months time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we‚Äôre learning. Learning about the audience we want to serve, about problems we enjoy solving, about ourselves. That‚Äôs all that can be said. We‚Äôre in a better place now than we were six months ago, that‚Äôs what matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Progress is incremental, remember that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre struggling with your startup, understand you‚Äôre not alone. Be sure to get accountable with where you‚Äôre at. I highly recommend joining a mastermind group that meets weekly to discuss current successes, failures and issues. If you‚Äôre not in one already, having this accountability, support, and outside perspective will be huge for you and your business. Reach out to a few like minded people on a similar path to you and see if they‚Äôre up for it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But most of all, don‚Äôt be ashamed of where you‚Äôre at, or what you‚Äôre doing. Be like us, just skeletons with flesh doing laps around the sun, desperately trying to work out what on earth we‚Äôre doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you struggling to keep on top of your startups monthly recurring expenses? We were, that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre building &lt;a href="https://prodigo.co/"&gt;prodigo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prodigo is a simple app that gives you actionable insights into the tools and services you‚Äôre paying for.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôre early stage and would love to shape this with you. If you‚Äôre interested you can sign up at &lt;a href="https://prodigo.co/"&gt;prodigo.co&lt;/a&gt; ‚úçÔ∏è  or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FredRivett"&gt;say hi and we can chat&lt;/a&gt; üëã&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A week ago &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marckohlbrugge"&gt;Marc K√∂hlbrugge&lt;/a&gt; released a neat little side project. The premise was simple, pay to get featured on the site. We‚Äôve seen this before, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/"&gt;The million dollar homepage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The twist here? The more you pay, the higher you‚Äôll be featured on the leaderboard. This gamified the system, with individuals and companies paying more and more for the highest position. Marc managed to use his existing networks to bring the initial burst of traffic through, and pretty soon the ball was well and truly rolling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want some traffic to your site now would be a good time to participate: &lt;a href="https://highscore.money/"&gt;http://highscore.money&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you want some traffic to your site now would be a good time to participate: &lt;a href="https://highscore.money/"&gt;http://highscore.money&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marckohlbrugge?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@marckohlbrugge on twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And by the end of the day Marc had done &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@marckohlbrugge/how-i-made-2-251-in-1-day-with-highscore-money-dd56b35b2681#.i58k99t77"&gt;pretty well&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sort of project clearly comes under the silly little side projects umbrella. It was an opportunistic attempt to make a quick buck, whilst providing value to those who paid for a slot and having fun along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As makers, quick side projects like this help flex our creative muscles. I don‚Äôt think Marc intended this to be a fully fledged business, he‚Äôs already focussed in on his main gig, BetaList, but that didn‚Äôt stop him spending a few days creating this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst following Marc‚Äôs launch day progress, one tweet from Marc struck me, and got me thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What's a good, privacy-friendly real-time website counter?
&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marckohlbrugge/status/737388891246891008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@marckohlbrugge on twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the second time I‚Äôd seen a request for some form of user facing site stats. A few weeks before, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin"&gt;Justin Jackson&lt;/a&gt; had written &lt;a href="https://justinjackson.ca/webmaster/"&gt;I‚Äôm a fucking webmaster&lt;/a&gt;, and wrote &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11685868"&gt;this comment on his Hacker News post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;BTW: does anyone know of a lightweight, retro ‚Äúhit counter‚Äù that can grab my GA stats and display them at the bottom?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pattern was forming here, enough for me to mention to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mikeaag"&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt; that this might be something for us to explore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike and I have been working on side projects for years, but only recently have we got into the habit of actually launching them. Having set ourselves the challenge to launch &lt;a href="https://blog.wearecontrast.com/introducing-sixbysix-217d608362#.gpqkok2i1"&gt;six projects in six months&lt;/a&gt; at the end of 2014, we‚Äôve launched &lt;a href="https://www.producthunt.com/@mikeaag/collections/i-made-that"&gt;8 side projects since&lt;/a&gt;, including writing our first book about the whole process, &lt;a href="https://learningtolaunch.co/"&gt;Learning to Launch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently though, we‚Äôve been focussing on thinking through problems we want to solve, areas of tech we‚Äôre interested in, potential markets we‚Äôd enjoy helping. We‚Äôve been thinking a lot about the startup we want to build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs easy to get stuck in analysis paralysis. It‚Äôs important that we keep moving forwards. That‚Äôs why, this past weekend, we spent most of it hacking together a small side project, inspired by Marc‚Äôs tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="introducing-real-time-users"&gt;Introducing Real Time Users&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you‚Äôve gotta have some fun and build stuff. That‚Äôs what Marc did, and that‚Äôs what we decided to do, too. Real Time Users is a little side project that makes us smile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real Time Users is vulnerable, it exposes the truth of how popular your site is. Go to it anytime, and you‚Äôll likely be greeted by the fact you‚Äôre the only person on the internet there. That‚Äôs both beautiful to know, that you are alone on this piece of internet real estate, and, as a creator, leaves me feeling slightly exposed. You know how popular my site is. For us at least, that‚Äôs a new level of transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Partially inspired by Marc‚Äôs leaderboard, we‚Äôve included &lt;a href="https://realtimeusers.bycontrast.co/leaderboard"&gt;one of our own&lt;/a&gt;. If you take the 60 seconds and add Real Time Users to your site, you‚Äôll likely take up one of the top 10 slots, until at least 8 others add it to their sites too. You‚Äôll be able to see whether anyone ever adds this to their site, simply by tracking whether those top 10 slots ever fill up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm proud of it, proud because, having discussed it a few times during the week, we only really got to work on it this past weekend, and by Sunday evening we were pretty much ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a walk with Mike the other night I asked him, how long would it have taken us to launch Real Time Users pre-SixBySix? His answer: &lt;em&gt;we‚Äôd have never shipped it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He‚Äôs right &lt;em&gt;(don‚Äôt tell him that)&lt;/em&gt;. We wouldn‚Äôt have. We would have added feature after feature, built with needless shiny technology, and delayed launching month by month as we strived to build the next Google Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since SixBySix, we‚Äôre much quicker to launch, and the quality has improved too. Our first project, &lt;a href="http://howsitgo.in/"&gt;HowsItGoin&lt;/a&gt; took 250 hours to ship. Real Time Users took under 15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs what we‚Äôve learnt, these past eighteen months. Ship stuff. Keep moving forwards. Learn as you go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Building and launching stuff is a skill, a habit, a muscle. The more you do it, the better you get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spending the past month or so thinking through what we want to be focussing on, the business we want to build, has been an essential step. But sometimes we need to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FredRivett/status/737384708024238084"&gt;step away from the magic whiteboards&lt;/a&gt; and get back to making stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who knows what‚Äôll come of it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How To Start Out When You're Just Starting Out By Someone Just Starting Out</title>

    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: This post consists of a brain dump of my current thoughts about how to best start a startup when doing it for the first time (which I currently am). I do not expect there to be only one way of doing this, this post is intended to spark discussion, so I would love to hear others opinions on this to see similarities / differences.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id="find-interesting-problems-whether-funserious-and-try-to-solve-them"&gt;1. Find interesting problems (whether fun/serious) and try to solve them&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my experience, it‚Äôs a fair whack easier to try and solve problems &lt;em&gt;you‚Äôre intimately aware of&lt;/em&gt;, than to try and observe and fix problems &lt;em&gt;other people&lt;/em&gt; are experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might sound obvious, but my approach to moving from where I am right now to where I want to be is &lt;em&gt;incremental&lt;/em&gt;. For a long time I used the approach of &lt;em&gt;shooting for the stars from day one&lt;/em&gt; and for a long time &lt;a href="http://wearecontrast.com/2014/11/introducing-sixbysix/"&gt;I failed to ship anything at all&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it makes sense to me to keep things as simple as possible, all the while making progress. That means trying to solve a problem you‚Äôre experiencing, before trying to solve someone else‚Äôs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs a lot of similarities between the two, but solving your own problems trims away the burden of observing other users and learning what their problems look like. Keep it simple. Start now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="build-quick-and-dirty-mvp"&gt;2. Build quick and dirty MVP&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what I‚Äôve spent 90% of my spare time doing for the past year, along with my &lt;em&gt;partner-in-crime&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://medium.com/u/67a4475456c"&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt;. We realised our problem was trying to make a fully-featured perfect product from day one. We‚Äôve learnt the hard way, spending years before learning this lesson. &lt;em&gt;It doesn‚Äôt work like that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, we committed to going from zero launches ever (unless you count &lt;a href="http://arethensawatchingme.com/"&gt;that silly little site&lt;/a&gt;) to &lt;a href="https://www.producthunt.com/@fredrivett/collections/things-i-ve-made"&gt;six in six months&lt;/a&gt;. We overshot on this by a few months, due to complications in the final project, but &lt;em&gt;learnt a tonne&lt;/em&gt; in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having the ability to take an idea, build it and launch it in the least time possible is a hugely important skill for wannabe entrepreneurs to learn. In my experience it has opened up a world of possibilities, knowing I can take an idea from concept to launch in a matter of weeks changes how I see potential projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the fact we‚Äôre &lt;em&gt;solving our own problem&lt;/em&gt;, customer research here can be minimal at best. We built &lt;a href="http://flashtabs.co/"&gt;FlashTabs&lt;/a&gt; in a weekend, fixed the bugs in the evenings of the week following, then shipped it. We knew the problem, so quickly built a solution and put it in front of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In reality, this part is where most of us fall down. We have this grand vision, start building it, but then somewhere down the line, with no end in sight, we give up. Mike and I know this intimately having lived there for many years. As a result of that, and our progress since, we‚Äôve spent the last few months writing a book on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are so many ‚Äúgotcha‚Äôs‚Äù that can cause our work to never see the light of day that we wanted to put it down in words so others can learn from some of the mistakes we‚Äôve made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We‚Äôre releasing it online, &lt;strong&gt;for free&lt;/strong&gt;, for anyone to read. Take a look. We‚Äôd love your feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Read: &lt;a href="https://learningtolaunch.co/read"&gt;learningtolaunch.co/read&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id="launch-it"&gt;3. Launch it&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put it out there. Push it out to people who might find it useful. Find communities where they hang out and share it there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you‚Äôve built your thing, it‚Äôs time to share it. &lt;em&gt;This step is not optional.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it something the early adopter tech community might be interested in? Look at how you can get it on &lt;a href="https://www.producthunt.com/"&gt;Product Hunt&lt;/a&gt;, and post it up on &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/"&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;. Is there a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/reddits/"&gt;sub-reddit&lt;/a&gt; where these people hang out? Post it there, explaining how you‚Äôre trying to solve a problem you‚Äôre experiencing and that you think they might be too. Write an introductory post on Medium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it more niche? Think of a few places they hang out and go there. Just be sure to get some of your potential target market to get their eyeballs on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="see-who-gravitates-towards-it"&gt;4. See who gravitates towards it&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you‚Äôve built and launched your product, you should hope to see some users start to gravitate towards it. This might be a handful, or it might be hundreds, depending on what you‚Äôre building and how easily you can reach that market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally, depending on what you‚Äôre building will dictate how much variety you‚Äôll find in the audience that gathers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre building a relatively generic product, like a time tracker app, then you may find a variety of different types of users start using it, and each may have their own reasons for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it makes sense that if what you‚Äôve built is clearly aimed at a more specific use case, then there will likely be less variety in the crowd that gathers and less variety in their needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://howsitgo.in/"&gt;HowsItGoin&lt;/a&gt; was launched as a very simple, generic web app to set and answer questions, tracking your results as you go. After launching we found a wide variety of ways people were using it, from fitness tracking, to journalling, to productivity tracking. There were many routes we could go and many problems we could focus on solving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://founderskit.co/"&gt;FoundersKit&lt;/a&gt;, however, was a specific product aimed at a specific market. We knew exactly the type of user we wanted to attract before even we‚Äôd launched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, take stock of the crowd that you draw, and look at the different groups that form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="gather-feedback"&gt;5. Gather feedback&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you‚Äôve launched, and you‚Äôve got a bunch of people using your product, you should be actively looking to gather feedback on how it‚Äôs being used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs here you‚Äôll want to focus on what problems your users are trying to solve and how well your current product is solving these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From our experience you can get a small initial batch of feedback (5‚Äì20 responses) from having a simple, prominent feedback call-to-action on your site. Tools like &lt;a href="https://www.typeform.com/"&gt;Typeform&lt;/a&gt; are perfect for this, taking minutes to setup and providing a simple UX for your users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If users were prompted to enter their email address in the registration process then you can look into reaching out to your user base and talking to as many of them as are willing to jump on a call with you. If they aren‚Äôt happy to jump on a call, then you can fall back on emailing your questions or pointing them to your survey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking to your users and hearing how they describe their problems and their thoughts on how well your product solves this (and vitally where it‚Äôs lacking) is invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="consider-whether-this-is-a-market-you-want-to-address"&gt;6. Consider whether this is a market you want to address&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might sound obvious, but just because a bunch of people are using your thing, you still need to work out if that‚Äôs a market you want to address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For us, with FlashTabs, we‚Äôve got a whole bunch of self-motivated, relatively tech savvy individuals looking to learn a new skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do we want to target the B2C market? Do we still find this problem interesting enough to want to work on it and build it out? Can we ever see this making enough money to warrant the time invested in it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For us these are questions we‚Äôve mulled over a lot. We could spin off a different product aimed at the same niche (web software for education), we could leave FlashTabs on auto pilot as is, or we could double down on it for a while and see if we can take this to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this stage you must decide, should I pivot or persevere?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For more on this, be sure to read the staple twenty-first century entrepreneurs handbook, &lt;a href="http://theleanstartup.com/"&gt;The Lean Startup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id="niche-down-hone-in-on-their-problems"&gt;7. Niche down, hone in on their problems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you‚Äôve got your product out in the wild, you‚Äôve found a market that resonates with it, it‚Äôs time to hone in on the problems your users are facing and solve these as best you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, I‚Äôm &lt;em&gt;massively&lt;/em&gt; oversimplifying this, a lot of blood, sweat and tears will be invested here, but now you‚Äôve got a product and a market to work with. You‚Äôve made a great start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be sure to solve a specific problems before considering whether to expand or not. This is the famed, elusive &lt;a href="http://www.startup-marketing.com/the-startup-pyramid/"&gt;product/market fit&lt;/a&gt; that every startup is so desperately searching for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If at any stage you seriously consider whether this product and this niche can ever achieve your goals (which you probably will), it‚Äôs time to revisit point 6 above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="grow"&gt;8.¬†‚Ä¶Grow?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you‚Äôve found that all elusive product/market fit, the real question is, what‚Äôs next? 99% of the time, in the startup world, that answer is grow grow grow. Take off. Shoot for the stars. And that‚Äôs a perfectly valid answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, it‚Äôs not always the route every entrepreneur wants to take. Not every entrepreneur envisions their life working 80 hour weeks, holding board meetings (growth requires capital requires investors) and taking their company public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every company is a lifestyle company, because surely you‚Äôre building a company because you want to live the lifestyle that comes with it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the kids say, &lt;a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/FuvVKU8Jxq1CE/giphy.gif"&gt;#yolo&lt;/a&gt;. If you don‚Äôt want to live the life of a big-time CEO of the next unicorn, &lt;em&gt;then don‚Äôt build that company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, I want to create a great product, that helps people live better lives, and supports me and my family for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That might come in the form of running a large organisation, or it might come running a small, two person business for the rest of my life. Both (and everything in between) are viable options.&lt;/p&gt;
