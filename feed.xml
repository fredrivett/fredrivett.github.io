    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Knowing where you’d like to go is important. It helps us frame the decisions we make now that move us towards where we want to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our book, &lt;a href="https://learningtolaunch.co/"&gt;Learning To Launch&lt;/a&gt;, we described how we strike the balance between the long term and short term:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Have long term goals in mind, and short term goals in focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means knowing where you’re trying to go and having that as a constant reference point in the back of your mind. &lt;strong&gt;A North Star that you use to guide you on the journey.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Mike and I, that North Star is freedom. Freedom from the 9-5. Freedom from selling our time. Free to choose how to spend it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the commitments we have, after doing some napkin maths, we’ve worked out we roughly need to be taking in £100k a year. We’ll likely be selling in dollars, so in reality that will be roughly $120k/year, or $10k MRR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That feels a long way off. We’ve launched &lt;a href="http://wearecontrast.com/"&gt;a few different things&lt;/a&gt; in the past, and &lt;a href="http://founderskit.co/"&gt;one of those&lt;/a&gt; is making a small amount of money, but we don’t have an easy pathway on how we’re going to get from here to there. There are so many unknowns, we’d never be able to predict the path we will take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s ok. Despite that, we’ve taken our best guess at breaking down the big goal into smaller, more attainable goals. Instead of trying to get to financial freedom now, we’re focussed on simply finding a problem that interests us, that we’d like to spend a few months finding out more about and attempting to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say any problem that we’d like to solve will do. There are other checks that have to be met, which fall under the broad heading of “how well placed are we to solve this?”. We’re not attempting to solve world hunger just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge with a goal so seemingly unattainable as financial freedom is that it can cripple us from moving forwards. If we focus too heavily on “will this idea ever earn $10k a month?” then we may never take that step and launch a product that can make us $100 a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to strike the right balance. &lt;a href="http://fredrivett.com/2016/08/29/healthy-pressure/"&gt;Some pressure is healthy&lt;/a&gt;. A little pressure can help bring clarity to what matters, but too much can stop us dead in our tracks. We need a pressure valve that we can tweak to keep us motivated without feeling overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For us, having that smaller, more attainable “find a problem that we’re interested in solving” goal helps lower the pressure. We can chip away at this and see progress take shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we attempt to move towards our goal, progress will never be linear. There will be times when we make great progress, and times when we feel we’re taking two steps forward and three steps back. This up and down journey leads to great highs and low lows, which is why we have to view progress over a greater period of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have I made progress this past six months? This year, 2016, did I move towards where I want to be, or have I stagnated? Am I on the right path, or do I need to make a change?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, as we look back, we’ve not made the progress we’d hoped to. I’m just being honest. We’ve made some, we’re in a better place now than we were twelve months ago, but we’ve wasted too much time going round in circles, &lt;a href="http://fredrivett.com/2016/10/03/am-i-doing-it-right/"&gt;stuck in analysis paralysis&lt;/a&gt;. We’re attempting to learn from that now and not make that same mistake again in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you look back over this year, take time to consider the highs and lows, and take time to think about whether where you want to go has changed, or whether you’ve lost track of your North Star. Recalibrate yourself to live 2017 with intentionality. Set a big ambitious goal and break it down into smaller attainable steps on the journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our plans never stay fully static, they always evolve and change as we move towards them, as they should. But having that North Star to look up to when the times are tough is important, else we wander, round and round, moving, but never actually getting anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Solving problems is at the heart of any great product or business. Behind every shiny product or lightbulb idea is a real problem being solved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When trying to solve a problem, there are two key activities we must undertake, data gathering and data connecting. The more data points you gather, the more you’ll have to connect together to form creative patterns. As Steve Jobs said, &lt;em&gt;“creativity is just connecting things.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to make the best data connections is to collect two types of data, specific and generic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specific data is the information you learn about the problem you’re trying to solve. So if you’re trying to help mechanics improve their day to day life, then you should spend time with some mechanics. Read a variety of mechanics books and magazines. Interview mechanics, asking them a bunch of open ended questions. Soak up all sorts of information about mechanics, why they do what they do, what they enjoy doing, what they dislike doing, what they struggle doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then once you’ve spent enough time getting into the head of the mechanics, you should start to see a pattern emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing this sort of investigating can be fun when you’re in the flow, other times it’s a bit of a drag but you plough on, but either way I find it easy to justify this time as work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other side to data gathering is the generic data points. This can come from anywhere. Reading about anything you’re interested in is a great way to collect generic data. Listening to podcasts or audio books and watching films and documentaries are more great ways to add depth and variety into our general data store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This generic data collection doesn’t feel like work at all, and it isn’t really, it’s just life. But the more non-specific data you collect the more interesting combinations you can make when you come to connect the data points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connecting the data points can happen anytime, anywhere. Often a good amount of this will happen hand in hand with gathering data points. As you’re learning about the people you’re looking to help and the problems they’re experiencing you’ll start to see threads appear between the different data points you’ve been gathering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often though, we need to get away from our normal surroundings to create the best connections. Have you ever noticed how many of our best ideas happen in the shower?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonah Lehrer thinks its to do with quietening ourselves, stopping ourselves from being externally distracted to listen to our subconscious that’s already been making some of these connections:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“…so many insights happen during warm showers. For many people, it’s the most relaxing part of the day. It’s not until we’re being massaged by warm water, unable to check our e-mail, that we’re finally able to hear the quiet voices in the backs of our heads telling us about the insight. The answers have been their all along–we just weren’t listening.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Showers are a classic breeding ground for creative connections, but so are quiet, scenic walks. I find I’m often scribbling down insights (read: tweeting) that come to me as I go for a walk through a local field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But despite this increased creativity, I often find it hard to justify going on these walks, as it doesn’t &lt;em&gt;feel like&lt;/em&gt; work (don’t worry I shower every day). Every step I take outside of my door is a step away from my laptop, where I &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; I should be, &lt;em&gt;being productive&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Doing the work&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s an issue. If I’m to solve the most interesting problems in the most effective, creative ways, then I need to give myself time to breathe. To quieten myself. To not be distracted. I need to take the time to connect the dots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is as much work as data gathering. I have to discipline myself to step away from my laptop and relax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find the balance between focus and quiet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The balance between data gathering and data connecting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That’s because they were able to connect experiences they’ve had and synthesize new things. And the reason they were able to do that was that they’ve had more experiences or they have thought more about their experiences than other people. Unfortunately, that’s too rare a commodity. A lot of people in our industry haven’t had very diverse experiences. So they don’t have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem. The broader one’s understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have.
&lt;cite&gt;Steve Jobs, Wired, February 1995&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was looking through our problem/idea list recently, and a few ideas jumped out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of those was an idea for goal tracking for teams. It was born from a personal pain point as an employee at a company that used to set short, medium and long term goals. The only issue was, they never told us what they were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I got thinking. What if I built something to solve this problem?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution I had in mind was just a simple system of logging goals, sharing and viewing them. The pain point was getting everyone on the same page. And it turns out &lt;em&gt;that was the problem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked about this in &lt;a href="http://startupfoundation.co/hashtag_startup/"&gt;Startup Chat&lt;/a&gt; recently, and someone mentioned how at her company of 30 they use a simple Google doc. No fancy software, just a simple shared doc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This surprised me. For a team of 30 I envisioned them using some purpose built tool with a few extra features, not a simple Google doc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then I remembered something &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin"&gt;Justin Jackson&lt;/a&gt; said a while back in his post, &lt;a href="https://justinjackson.ca/we-are-not-normal-people/"&gt;we are not normal people&lt;/a&gt;. He was at his barbers, dreaming of how he could improve their scheduling setup. How he could build out a new software solution that would bring the hairdressers archaic paper system into the twenty-first century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out, his barber had already tried out a bunch of software solutions, likely from similar conversations had with other tech minded clients, and they were all horrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One particular point of Justin’s story stands out. His barber said this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"All the software I’ve tried just gets in the way."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is key. Software, far from being a knight in shining armour, was actually overkill for him. An unnecessary burden. It was a more complicated process than simply looking at a paper calendar and writing directly on that. It wasn’t a problem he was motivated to solve because the core of the pain point was solved in the simplest way possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any software solution might make gains on the periphery but the core issue was already solved for the one that mattered. The barber was the one who used the system and who decided how their businesses money would be spent, and they were not motivated to fix this problem because they didn’t see it as a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same goes for my company goal tracking idea. There could be some gains made by using a purpose built piece of software, but the core task of logging goals and being able to view them was already solved. It’s solved by whiteboards and it’s solved by shared docs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem, in my mind, was getting everyone &lt;em&gt;on the same page.&lt;/em&gt; The issue with this idea was that the tools they were using already did this, quite literally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In development terms, all I was looking to create was a glorified &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete"&gt;CRUD&lt;/a&gt;. Create goals. Read goals. Update goals. Delete goals. Whiteboards or shared docs are the best solution for this for a lot of companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a common problem. &lt;em&gt;The problem entrepreneurs have with problems.&lt;/em&gt; As creative entrepreneurial types, we’re always on the lookout for problems we can solve. Processes we can improve. Shiny things we can create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to try and create systems and solutions that are complex and beautiful but people just want the easiest, simplest way to get the job done. Often that’s using a tool they already have and know how to use. A new shiny interface isn’t a plus, it’s a hindrance.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;But.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s flawed.&lt;br /&gt;
But there’s competitors.&lt;br /&gt;
But it’ll be hard.&lt;br /&gt;
But I don’t know how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s so easy to let but stop us. It stops us from taking steps forwards, for fear that it might not work out. Fear that we’ll waste our time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So instead, we wait for perfect. We wait for that moment when &lt;em&gt;the idea&lt;/em&gt; comes. We wait for &lt;em&gt;the one&lt;/em&gt;, that’s a sweet combination of unique genius, no competition, that requires nothing new from us, no new learning, everything is  known.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wait. But the idea never comes. Nothing quite holds up. Everything has a reason to stop us pursuing it. But. But. But.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every idea starts out like this. I've yet to come across a problem that's not being solved &lt;em&gt;somehow&lt;/em&gt;, an idea that doesn't have some weaknesses, an idea that doesn't force me to do &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; I've not done before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perfection freezes us in our tracks. It stops us from ever moving forwards. At some point we’ve got to leave perfection behind, and move ahead into the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dance with the idea. Play with it. Try things out. Embrace the frailties, embrace the unknown. Embrace the likelihood of failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop waiting for the perfect moment.&lt;br /&gt;
Stop waiting for the perfect problem.&lt;br /&gt;
Stop waiting for the perfect team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s been said that to achieve great work you must kill your darlings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s what we’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past few months we’ve spent a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of time on our new podcast, &lt;a href="http://hitreply.co/"&gt;Hit Reply&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d spend a few hours prepping each episode, often more, and then a couple of hours each recording it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Podcasting is new for us. It’s different to our previous projects.  It’s taken time to get going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge has been how can we create as much value for our listeners in as little time for them? Could we provide the same amount of value in a compact 20 minute episode as a longer 45 minute episode?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were conscious of wanting to create something that had the highest return on investment for our listeners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the emphasis on not wasting people’s time, on trimming the fluff, has led to bloated time investment on our side. It’s led to a podcast that’s become almost a spoken blog post. &lt;em&gt;It’s not what we set out to do in the beginning.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve spent the past month or so thinking through where we want to go, whether our goals are still the same as they were before, and whether our current activities are the best way to get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, we’ve come to realise that the podcast’s not been the right &lt;a href="https://justinjackson.ca/want/"&gt;product/founder fit&lt;/a&gt; for us right now. It’s not been utilising our strengths, our unfair advantages, it’s not the most effective way to go from where we are now to where we want to be. It’s not been the best use of our time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, we’re going to focus on a new plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new plan is fairly simple. We’re going to talk to people about what they do and any struggles they have until we discover a problem worth solving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll prototype and develop. Test out ideas and learn. And we’ll go from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all sounds rather fluffy. To combat that, we've set quarterly goals we'll aim to meet, and will be accountable to our &lt;a href="https://ryanbattles.com/post/what-is-a-mastermind-group"&gt;mastermind groups&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s painful to stop something we’ve invested a fair amount of time in already, something that’s already providing a certain amount of value. But if we’re to ever get to where we want to be, we’ve got to focus on the work that will help get us there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve got to &lt;a href="http://fredrivett.com/2016/10/31/create-your-own-path/"&gt;create our own path&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve got to kill our darlings.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The days go by quicker now. It’s Monday again. Where did that week go?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The years go by quicker now. It’s New Years Eve again. Where did that year go?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re all so &lt;em&gt;busy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sometimes wonder about how we should best live our lives. We’re often so intent on cramming &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; into every crevice of our every day lives that we never take the time to simply be. To be present &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; that day. To take time &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; a moment. To pick our head up and look around, and just be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re too busy getting &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;. Going to that &lt;em&gt;other place&lt;/em&gt;. Making sure we’re ready for it. Making sure that we’ll be prepared when it comes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it comes, and we’re busy. Too busy to notice. To realise that anything much is going on. Too numbed by constant movement to appreciate that the very moments we’re preparing for are passing us by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s so easy to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I’m being wise? If I stop being busy now, my future will be worse. There is definitely an element of truth to this. We cannot simply stop preparing for the future and live in today. Tomorrow will come too, we hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must strike the balance. Balance between creating the best future for tomorrow, whilst not repeatedly giving over all of today for it. We have to claim back some of today. We have to cash in some of our time. We have to budget for living, for being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we never stop to live, to breathe, to be, the next time we look up we’ll realise life has passed us by again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s be present in the moment. Be conscious of our blessings, and conscious of our challenges. Try to be thankful for what we’ve got, if we can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being present sounds like airy fairy rubbish, but it’s important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s set aside time when we’re not &lt;em&gt;busy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s be present.&lt;/p&gt;
